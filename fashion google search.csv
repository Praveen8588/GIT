Over 4,000 guests- David Beckham, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Gigi Hadid among them- gathered to toast the rebranded British Fashion Awards - now known simply as ' The Fashion Awards’ . The ceremony has now finished, with those who have shaped fashion this year awarded for their contributions. Watch | Naomie Campbell attends the British Fashion Awards ceremony 02:05 David Beckham presented American designer Ralph Lauren with an Outstanding Achievement award for carving out a globally-known business dedicated to the All-American look- from jeans and tees to Oscar gowns, Lauren's done it all. The most closely-watched contest of the night saw supermodel sister against supermodel sister as Bella and Gigi Hadid were both nominated in the International Model of the Year category . Older sister Gigi emerged victorious, wearing a dramatic Atelier Versace look to collect her award. Never mind Bella, there's always next year. Ooyala video ID: w4ZGwyODE6GGHkkdouzsgk5VWqUD6qCr Edit... Delete The Duchess of Cambridge's favourite design house Alexander McQueen picked up the British Brand of the Year accolade which creative director Sarah Burton dedicated to the 'amazing team' which helps her to put together spellbindingly beautiful catwalk collections which translate then into clothes which women want to wear. Lady Gaga, Kate Moss, Jenna Coleman - and even Marilyn Manson - were among the stars who graced the red carpet. British Vogue rounded off a stellar centenary year with a Special Recognition Award. Demna Gvasalia status as fashion's wunderkind du jour was confirmed once more as he scooped up two prizes at The Fashion Awards. The first for International Urban Luxury Brand with the design collective Vetements which he founded and which has become a must-wear for fashion editors and cutting-edge celebrities alike. Next up, Gvasalia was awarded International Ready-to-Wear designer for his reinvention of the storied Parisian fashion house Balenciaga. Young Brits Molly Goddard , Simone Rocha and Craig Green also scooped up awards. 2016 Fashion Awards red carpet best looks R ead through all the action as it happened in our live feed below... beauty tips Fashion Awards 11:11PM Tears and laughter backstage for the 2016 Fashion Award winners Donatella Versace and Gigi Hadid posing backstage Credit: Emily Cronin T here was a jovial mood backstage at the 2016 Fashion Awards. Marilyn Manson, the night’s unexpected guest who had presented his friend Demna Gvasalia with the International Urban Luxury Brand award, was busily editing the pictures that had been taken of him. “If I don’t get laid tonight, I’m going to tag you and blame you personally,” he joked, as he poured over pictures of him posing on the red carpet earlier. Marilyn Manson sorting through pictures of him backstage Credit: Emily Cronin B ut for all the hysteria, there was emotion too from the winners of these newly revamped Fashion Awards. “Before the show my dad told me, ‘If you don’t win, you’re still a good designer,’” Simone Rocha admitted. “But I wanted it. I wanted to win.” Rocha celebrated by knocking back a few espresso martinis with friend and fellow winner Molly Goddard, who was so shell-shocked by winning her first ever award she wasn’t even sure what she was going to do with the statuette. “Now I just need a fireplace.” Fellow first-time winner, menswear designer of the year Craig Green was equally blown away. “Oh my god, I probably should have prepared a speech, I probably shouldn’t have worn dirty Converse and a T-shirt,” he faux scolded himself. Molly Goddard posing with Alexa Chung backstage Credit: Emily Cronin B ut it wasn’t just the young British designer who were excited by their acclaim. Legendary photographer Bruce Weber told The Telegraph’s Emily Cronin that he was going to keep his Fashion Award in his oceanfront cabana in Florida - and that it would continue to inspire him. “I’m still a student. I have to work for it everyday just like somebody starting out,” he said. A poignant reminder that humility will always be in style. The Fashion Awards 2016 | Who won what? 10:35PM David Beckham presents Ralph Lauren with the Outstanding Achievement award T he biggest cheer of the night has gone to David Beckham, who took the stage in a velvet jacket to present Ralph Lauren with an Outstanding Achievement award. ""I've long been a fan of this man and his extraordinary work,"" Beckham said of Lauren, before admitting he'd not met him until a chance encounter at Soho Farmhouse earlier this year. Beckham in a velvet Ralph Lauren jacket N o matter though because Beckham knew Lauren's work. The first American to open a store on Bond Street and, in Beckham's words, the man who made Wimbledon the most stylish sporting event, Lauren has built a globally renowned business around the idea of All-American style. Ralph Lauren and wife Ricky wore matching bow ties on the 2016 Fashion Awards red carpet. Credit: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock B ut even though we knew it was coming Ralph Lauren's lifetime achievement award comes at the end of a particularly momentous year for the 77 year-old designer. Lauren played a fascinating role in the American presidential election, creating a series of suits for self-confessed 'pantsuit aficionado' Hillary Clinton to wear during key moments of her campaign, from the blue look she wore for her opening rally in June 2015 to the purple-edged outfit which nodded to the Suffragettes as she accepted defeat in November. Watch | Ralph Lauren's key years in 60 seconds 01:07 ‘I didn’t know the significance of that colour,’ he admitted to The Telegraph's Lisa Armstrong in an interview to mark his Outstanding Achievement award , ‘but Hillary’s people did. I just knew it looked beautiful on her.’ Designer fact file | Ralph Lauren L auren's name is recognised the world over; his Polo t-shirts and jeans have become iconic staples for casual dressing but he also knows how to create impact for formal occassions; he has dressed Michelle Obama and many First Ladies before her as well as Hollywood actresses including Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Sienna Miller for the most demandingly dressed-up events on the world stage. The Telegraph's Fashion Director @misslisaarmstrong with the legend Ralph Lauren at The Fashion Awards ? . . . #telegraphfashion #telegraph #fashionawards2016 #bringonthebolly #ralphlauren A photo posted by Telegraph Fashion & Beauty (@telegraphfashion) on Dec 5, 2016 at 12:49pm PST ‘I don’t know where it came from,’ he says of the instinct for design which came when he began creating ties as a young man, ‘but I knew what I was doing was good because I wanted to wear it.’ ralph lauren greatest fashion moments 10:28PM Demna Gvasalia wins International Ready To Wear Designer for his work at Balenciaga I t’s clearly Demna Gvasalia’s night as the designer picks up his second award, for his work as Creative Director of Balenciaga. It’s a notable accolade: Gvasalia has been at the helm of the storied Parisian house for barely a year writes The Telegraph 's Victoria Moss. Whilst eyebrows may have been raised when his appointment was made to this venerated position: the move has worked. Balenciaga was the king of futuristic, modern fashion, and Gvasalia is exactly that today. He might not have brought tracksuits to the house of Balenciaga - but striped Thai market bags, fluoro leggings and oversized puffa jackets (worn off the shoulder - the christening of perhaps one of the more victim-y and daft street style ‘trends’) have found new fans here. Yet, he has also taken the house codes on and adeptly interpreted them: tweed suits with padded front pockets and prominent shoulders have proved to be a surefire success, and re-established that classic Balenciaga silhouette as relevant once again. All in all, given the extreme heat rising off Gvasalia right now - he is simply the fashion super star du jour . Designer fact file: Demna Gvasalia 10:24PM Gucci's Alessandro Michele wins Accessories Designer of the Year 'Fashion is a beautiful dream and I promise I'll keep dreaming forever,' Alessandro Michele said on stage picking up his award for Accessories Designer of the Year. Alessandro Michele on the red carpet ahead of the Fashion Awards Credit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock L ast year he won Designer of the Year, this year Michele has been recognised for the immense service he’s paid to the accessories world, writes The Telegraph's Kate Finnigan. Actually, remind us. Where was the world of accessories before Alessandro Michele? Wearing one minimalist earring, we think. Well, that’s changed. With a single pair of slip on, fur-lined loafers he reinvented shoes. With his blingy grandmother’s attic treasures he coaxed us back into enjoying jewellery - even brooches. With his embroidered colourful bags he has injected joy into arm candy again. And by putting all his models in glasses he made spectacles spectacular. Who’d have thunk. More is more is his mantra and for that accessories do indeed owe him this award. Let’s hope it's multi-coloured and bling-tastic. Designer fact file: Alessandro Michele 10:17PM Gigi Hadid scoops her sister Bella to win International Model of the Year Gigi Hadid getting emotional on stage I n a room full of supermodels (Karlie Kloss at 6 foot 6 and a half in heels towering over them all), the International Model of the Year award was always going to be high octane. So it wasn’t a surprise that Gigi Hadid got weepy on stage collecting her award. Social media also erupted - no doubt in part because of the 26 million followers Gigi has on Instagram alone. Gigi and Donatella do the mannequin challenge T here’s no doubt her social media presence has lent Gigi an appearance of intimacy with her fans which earlier generations of supermodels could never hope to achieve. But to dismiss Gigi’s power as purely a result of the ‘likes’ she can acquire on social media would be unfair. This year alone, she’s showed serious prowess on the catwalk. Walking down the Bottega Veneta catwalk hand in hand with Lauren Hutton was one of the biggest moments of Milan Fashion Week. And Gigi’s see-now-buy-now collection for Tommy Hilfiger, which the model debuted at New York Fashion Week, a massive commercial success. gigi hadid lookbook best looks style fashion G igi is a model who has managed to throw off the It girl tag and associations of nepotism (her mum Yolanda van den Herik is a former model, who is herself said to be worth $54 million and is best known as a star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills; her dad a wealthy property developer) to forge what’s turning out to be a seriously reputable career in modelling. The only person who might not be so thrilled? Her sister Bella, who was also nominated in the International Model of the Year award but, perhaps forewarned she hadn’t won, was a no show tonight. Still, something tells us the Hadid sisters will dominate these awards - and many more - for a few more years to come. Gigi Hadid catwalk highlights 10:13PM Jaden and Willow Smith get an unexpected award for New Fashion Icons A pleated skirt may not sound like the most wave-making of garments. But when the pleated skirt in question appears on Jaden Smith, son of Will and Jada Pinkett, in a Louis Vuitton campaign, it’s a tsunami. Jaden Smith in a full Gucci look at tonight's awards Credit: Stuart C. Wilson ""He represents a generation that has assimilated the codes of true freedom, one that is free of manifestos and questions about gender,” Vuitton creative director Nicolas Ghesquière said. “Wearing a skirt comes as naturally to him as it would to a woman who, long ago, granted herself permission to wear a man’s trench or a tuxedo…. He’s found an instinctive balance that makes his extraordinary attitude a new norm. That really inspired me in the creative process for this collection.” 2016 was full of gender-bending, groundbreaking fashion moments for Jaden, now 18 years old, and sister Willow, 16, who jointly received the New Fashion Icons trophy at tonight’s Fashion Awards. While Jaden made headlines with his skirted campaign and star turn in The Get Down, Willow joined the ranks of Chanel ambassadors, sitting in the front row and posing for backstage photos with Karl Lagerfeld. “It’s not every day that a 15 year-old black girl with dreads gets elected to be the Chanel ambassador,” she told The Telegraph at Chanel’s autumn 2016 couture show. Overachieving teens, meet your new leaders. 10:08PM Marilyn Manson (yes, really) presents Demna Gvasalia with International Urban Luxury Brand T hat an ‘urban’ luxury brand award even exists is testament to the extraordinary effect the Georgian Demna Gvasalia has had on the fashion industry . Having cut his teeth working at Maison Martin Margiela and Louis Vuitton (under both Marc Jacobs and Nicolas Ghesquiere), Vetements was launched as a ‘design collective’ helmed by Gvasalia but two years ago writes The Telegraph 's Victoria Moss. stars in vetements T he label was a provocateur from the off - staging its second season show in a sex shop, its third at an out of town Parisian chinese restaurant, it’s fourth, in the American church in Paris (where vaulted stylist Lotta Volkova - and friend of the brand - opened the show in a mini dress approximation of a monk’s habit). The clothes were arch, oversized, streetwear appropriated pieces - the theory being that they were simply making elevated, fashion versions of clothes that they and their friends were already wearing. Cult (and sell out) items swiftly followed: £880 jeans hand stitched together from off cuts; bright yellow DHL t-shirts; ditsy printed midi length tea dresses;Titanic sweatshirts - emblazoned with Leo and Kate in embrace - and worn, with a post-post modern irony by Celine Dion amongst others. At its last show (staged during Haute Couture week in Paris, and in the Galeries Lafayette shopping centre - very meta) Vetements created an epic montage of collaborations - re-anointing Juicy Couture velour tracksuits, Dr Martens boots and Manolo Blahnik kitten heels as It items. In the midst of this counter cultural take over, Gvasalia was christened by Balenciaga as its new creative director. The move cemented him as an arch arbiter of the current state of fashion, and propelling what may have passed as a flash in the trend pan into a full blown movement: the reverberations of which are felt clearly by this award. 10:00PM Gucci's Marco Bizzari is International Business Leader I t’s rare that the men in suits get praise for their contribution to fashion but Marco Bizarri scored a blinder when he hired Alessandro Michele, an unknown member of the creative team, for this very high profile role writes The Telegraph 's Kate Finnigan. Part of a business leader’s job is to spot the talent and boy, did he do that. He saw that Michele was the right man to inject the va-va-voom that Gucci had been lacking. He encouraged him to be as creative as he liked. The result has been a huge revival in the 95-year-old Italian label’s fortunes, not because he’s played clever with money or marketing, or played it safe. Far from it. Bizzari allowed creative talent to live large and thereby taught everyone a lesson in how to do fashion. Stars wearing Gucci 9:56PM Alexander McQueen wins the British Brand Award A lexander McQueen wins the award for British brand, cementing creative director Sarah Burton's seemingly unstoppable ability to create divinely beautiful collections which translate into clothes which women want to buy and wear. Nicole Kidman wearing McQueen T his year alone, Burton has whipped up breathtakingly lovely shows inspired by ideas as varied as dreams and sleepwalking and rugged Hebridean adventures. The second-to-last look of her Autumn/Winter show, which took place in London as Burton was to give birth imminently to her third daughter, was a delicate silk eiderdown coat which had attendees enthralled by its beguiling mix of prettiness and comfort. celebrities wearing alexander mcqueen A longside her ever more artful collections, Burton and her team adeptly re-spin them for modern life. While the Duchess of Cambridge might not be your 'average' woman, she has continued to commission McQueen to create looks which are royal-engagement-worthy and fly the flag for British fashion. Some Telegraph team highlights: the red and white floral patterned dress (taken from the etchings seen on old caravans and canal boats) which the duchess wore on the first day of her tour to Canada, the Paisley-printed, peplum shift which united British and Indian tradition worn in Mumbai and the unusually playfully 'Obsessions' dress debuted at the Wimbledon final. Bravo Sarah Burton and team McQueen! Designer fact file | Sarah Burton 9:50PM Yes, people working in fashion *do* eat… F or those wondering whether people working in fashion eat more than sushi, the answer is a resounding yes. Whilst the awards are happening, those at tables are eating fillets of beef with salt-baked celeriac and English wasabi - and even a side of chips. OK, polenta chips but still…. Meanwhile, for dessert there’s a Christmas vibe going on with mince pies on the menu. As for the drinks? By the end of the night the British Fashion Council estimate the guests will have drunk 700 bottles of Evian and 700 more of Badoit sparkling water. Rock and roll. Don't worry, there were Ciroc Vodka cocktails too. The tables at the 2016 Fashion Awards 9:43PM Brtish Vogue rounds off its 100th year with a Special Recognition Award I n a night all about celebrating British design personalities, perhaps it was only appropriate that the 4,000 guests paid special recognition for the magazine that has spent 100 years writing about them. The Editor-in-Chief of UK Vogue Alexandra Shulman was presented with an award to celebrate the title’s centenary by Mario Testino - the photographer who has become a household name and an A-list favourite thanks to the images he’s shot for the magazine. Vogue's centenary issue cover, starring the Duchess of Cambridge I t rounds off a stellar year for Shulman, who marked Vogue’s centenary by doing what Vogue does best: pulling in exclusives that keep the industry talking. That certainly happened when Shulman managed to persuade the Duchess of Cambridge to make her first appearance on the cover of a magazine - and hiding the coup from the BBC cameras who had spent 10 months in Vogue’s offices trailing the team for a documentary about their centenary. “That girl next door is just shtick,” Vogue’s Fashion Director Lucinda Chambers told The Telegraph of styling the astute Duchess in Burberry and a Beyond Retro vintage hat. Vogue covers through the ages S omeone else who isn’t exactly as you’d expect is Vogue’s editor herself. Whilst some thought Shulman came across quite austere on the BBC’s documentary, her own diary of Vogue’s 100th year presents a very different view - and one that most people within the industry recognise. Talking of her fear of flying and always having the wrong underwear, Shulman told The Telegraph earlier this year that her biggest responsibility - and the thing that really kept her awake at night - was making her magazine excellent month in month out. Perhaps tonight’s industry recognition might help ease her concerns. Profile | Alexandra Shulman 9:39PM 'Sing your own song loud with your own lyrics and baby I want you to be on fire' says Bruce Weber as he collects his award ""Three men have changed how I see America: Mark Twain, Walt Disney and Bruce"" says Bailey. So who is Weber, the man honoured with tonight's award in memory of the legendary fashion stylist Isabella Blow, who nurtured the likes of John Galliano and Alexander McQueen? R emember those steamy Calvin Klein and Abercrombie & Fitch campaigns from the 1990s? Of course you do - the tanned, muscular men in the photos were always going to make for indelible images, writes The Telegraph 's Emily Cronin. They’re only part of the reason that Bruce Weber, the photographer behind those campaigns and countless other memorable photographs, wins the Fashion Creator award this evening, a prize five decades in the making. ""Bruce’s endurance is testament to his pure talent, his undeniable creativity and his singular warmth and generosity,"" says the British Fashion Council's chairman, Dame Natalie Massenet. ""His expansive body of work in photography and film is iconic, and he himself is rightly an icon of the creative fashion community. He is one of the foremost photographers and creative talents of our age who has helped shape the fashion industry we know today and I have a great deal of admiration for him.” @gigihadid in @versace_official, Chicago, 2016. A photo posted by Bruce Weber (@bruce_weber) on Dec 4, 2016 at 11:24am PST 9:31PM Simone Rocha wins British Womenswear Designer S he scooped the New Establishment award two years ago and now Simone Rocha has scooped the big one. Congratulations, Ms Rocha! There’s really no stopping this designer, who recently turned 30 and celebrated the first birthday of her daughter, Valentine. Rocha’s hybrid aesthetic of Japanese avant-garde and Victoriana, using experimental fabrics and off-centre silhouettes, is unique in womenswear and gave her brand an immediately indentifiable look when she launched 8 years ago. She continues to conjure up one stellar collection after another and a growing collection of accessories and jewellery. With the most prestigious international stockists, from Dover Street Market to Colette, she opened her first London shop a year ago. A second is on its way for New York. A look from Simone Rocha's SS17 collection “I’ve always made clothes for many different kinds of women,” she told The Telegraph in her melodious Dublin brogue earlier this year. “And now I physically see them coming into my store – older women, mothers and daughters, students, people who are obsessed with fashion and some who aren’t really that interested. And I get good insights from them. The other day Lynn Yaeger [a renowned New York fashion journalist] was saying, “They’re so comfortable, did you know that?” And I was like, “Erm, yes, it’s on purpose, Lynn! I spend a lot of time making the clothes comfortable so that every­one can wear them."" 9:29PM Craig Green wins British Menswear Designer W hen Craig Green launched his showstopping catwalk collections, he had to contend with a great of tabloid tittering from the sniping ‘who would actually wear this?’ brigade, writes The Telegraph's Stephen Doig. Granted, wooden planks across the face, tent structures aloft around men’s shoulders and a smashed up collage of cardboard boxes around the heads of his models were a tough sell, but served to put his shows, and the burgeoning London Collections Men showcase as it then was, on the map. A look from Craig Green's SS17 collection Credit: Jonathan Hordle/REX/Shutterstock S kip to the Fashion Awards this evening and it’s clear that anyone who wrote Green off as a one-hit catwalk theatrics wonder did so at their peril. As proved when the designer won the GQ Fashion Fund earlier this year, Green’s aesthetic might be one of haute-conceptualism, but his brand is grounded in reality - gauzy tops and neat jackets make up the core product that sell in their droves, away from the more hifalutin pieces. Taking his cue from the codes of uniform - workwear, school attire, even monastic robes - Green’s served to push the boundaries of London menswear and remind the press that so oft overlook the city why it’s such a talent treasure trove. 9:26PM Franca Sozzani gets a standing ovation T he editor of Italian Vogue has been honoured with the Swarovski award for Positive Change . Tom Ford introduced Sozzani, saying that she has an ""inspiring sense of repsonsibility"", ""made the impossible, possible"" and ""challenges the orthodox"". On a more frivolous note, Kate Finnigan reports that Sozzani uis wearing a pink nightie which is 2v Karen Carpenter"". WINNER: @francasozzani wins the #Swarovski Award for Positive Change presented to her by @TOMFORD #FashionAwards — BFC (@BFC) December 5, 2016 T he audience gives her a standing ovation. Brava Franca! 9:15PM A few minutes into the ceremony and the Trump jokes have already begun... E veryone knows that the fashion industry is a mainly Democrat-supporting crowd so of course the issue of Trump was always going to loom over tonight's Fashion Awards. Trust host Jack Whitehall, back for another year of presenting, to break the ice early on. ""To all the models, if you work really hard you could end up married to a psychotic nutter"" he quipped (in case you don't gettit, incoming FLOTUS Melania Trump was once a model. Melania Trump was once a model W hitehall also addressed Ralph Lauren who will be receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award later tonight. ""Ugh, I love your Polo shirts"" he told the designer, speaking for every everyman out there. 9:12PM And the first award of the night goes to Molly Goddard, for British Emerging Talent B reaking onto the scene just 18 months ago with her autumn/winter 2015 collection, Molly Goddard has put the fun back into fashion, writes The Telegraph ’s Sophie Warburton. Her first on-schedule presentation was staged as a life-drawing class, with sketching models wearing boiled wool cardigans and Molly's signature smocked tulle dresses. Rihanna wearing Molly Goddard in May 2016 Credit: AKM-GSI-XPOSURE U p next was the sandwich factory for SS16, and most recently the rave-culture inspired spring/summer '17. Each season has seen Goddard grow: both on her playful approach to traditional hand-crafted techniques including pleating, smocking and crocheting and in her loyal followers. A favourite amongst fashion editors, her dresses have been shot countless times, while the designer has also been collecting celebrity fans on her way. Rihanna was spotted wearing the label in New York in the summer, while model-cum-actress Agyness Deyn got married in a custom Goddard gown earlier this year.

Bella and Gigi are up against each other in the International Model category. In fact, it was a family affair as Gigi Hadid (wearing Atelier Versace) walked the red carpet with her mum Yolanda. The sisters were both standout stars from the recent fashion weeks, where they appeared alongside each other in the Versace, Bottega Veneta, Max Mara and Fendi shows. Naturally, the sisters are also huge on social media - Gigi has 26 million followers on Instagram alone - lending them an appearance of intimacy with their fans which earlier generations of supermodels could never hope to achieve. Gigi Hadid is wearing a custom made Versace design. Credit: AP C aroline Rush CBE, the chief executive of the British Fashion Council, which runs the awards, said either one would be a worthy winner. “Bella and Gigi are two distinctive personalities who seem to have found their feet so young,” she said.“Both are incredibly talented models but the nominations show that our voting panel also recognises the power of social media. Both young women are brilliant examples of businesswomen who have been able to harness the consumer demand to engage with the personality."" Gigi v Bella Hadid head to head S till, it’s the first time that sisters have been nominated in the same category, so what sets the Hadids apart? At first glance it certainly might seem that the pair have CVs that read like that of countless American models: born in LA, dreamt of becoming athletes at school, gave up their studies after being discovered, won a contract with a big name designer, appeared in the pages of Vogue. But there is something that sets the sisters apart, and it’s not just the fact they both have blue-green eyes. The two are of Palestinian-Dutch extraction, making them something of a rarity on the runway. Their father Mohammed Hadid is a wealthy property developer, said to be worth between $100 and $200 million, who is reputedly descended from the Bedouin princes of pre-war Palestine. Gigi and Bella’s mother Yolanda van den Herik - who was in Paris last week to watch her daughters become the first sisters to take part in the Victoria's Secret show - is a former model, who is herself said to be worth $54 million and is best known as a star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Gigi posed on the steps of the Royal Albert Hall at the 2016 Fashion Awards Credit: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock I n 2014, Bella moved to New York and began studying photography before dropping out to begin her modelling career. She had wanted to compete in the equestrian events at the 2016 Rio Olympics, but was forced to abandon riding after contracting Lyme disease , along with her mother and brother Anwar, who is also a model. Gigi also moved to New York after leaving high school, where, like her sister, she signed with the agency IMG Models in 2013. Two years later, she appeared in the Pirelli calendar and was named Maybelline brand ambassador. gigi hadid lookbook best looks style fashion B ut the meteoric rise of the Hadid girls has not been without its moments of controversy. In July 2014, Bella, then aged 17, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol on LA’s Pacific Coast Highway. She was sentenced to 25 hours' community service and required to attend 20 hours of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. And on US election night, as the results in favour of Donald Trump rolled in, Bella wrote on Twitter: “This is so f***** up” and “What the f***”. Later, Gigi was criticised for performing an impression of future First Lady Melania Trump imitating President Obama’s wife Michelle, while she was co-hosting the American Music Awards. The model, who is dating Zayn Malik, apologised to Mrs Trump and said she had “only the best wishes for our country.” 7:08PM Marilyn Manson takes the prize for most unexpected guest on the 2016 Fashion Awards red carpet T he prize for most unexpected guest on the 2016 Fashion Awards must go to Marilyn Manson, who has just trotted down the red carpet dressed head-to-toe in black, naturally. (His shoes, meanwhile, were a gift from Gareth Pugh). Whilst there’s no obvious reason why the Prince of Darkness is at the biggest night in British fashion, it’s certainly true that the industry have embraced him. Manson was recently shot by controversial photographer Terry Richardson for the 25th anniversary issue of DAZED, wearing mock band slogan tops from cult label Vetements’ AW16 collection. Could this be a clue? Or indeed a taster of things to come? (Because, side note: can you imagine if Vetements’ next cult t-shirts had Mr Manson’s name emblazoned across the chest?).

She couldn’t get over the fact the singer stopped to admire her neon green Molly Goddard dress. “I love that! If I could have got a compliment from anyone in the room tonight...” she laughed, before skipping off excitedly inside.

Keep refreshing this gallery, right here... 2016 Fashion Awards red carpet best looks 6:34PM We're LIVE from the Fashion Awards red carpet I t's freezing cold but the stars are arriving at the Fashion Awards thick and fast. The Telegraph's Bethan Holt and Emily Cronin are quizzing them on all things style right now on Facebook Live. 6:26PM Will Sir Philip Green be at this year's Fashion Awards? F rom one of the original fashion bloggers Susie Bubble’s Susannah Lau to Kate Moss, Anna Wintour and David Beckham, the guest list for tonight’s 2016 Fashion Awards reads like a who’s who of British Fashion. But one person who we’re not sure whether will be attending is Sir Philip Green. Oh hi just getting ready for the #FashionAwards 2016 in masses of grey tulle courtesy of @mollymgoddard ?????? pic.twitter.com/ZVn7RJkLRP — susiebubble (@susiebubble) December 5, 2016 T he Topshop proprietor is normally stationed front and centre, happily surrounded by the notable celebrities present. Last year, his daughter Chloe even accompanied him on the red carpet. Chloe Green accompanied her father to the 2015 British Fashion Awards Credit: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock B ut since MPs voted to strip him of his knighthood in light of the BHS backlash, the Green family have kept an unusually low profile. Sir Philip skipped the Topshop Unique show SS17 show at September’s London Fashion Week, preferring, his aides said to let the see-now-buy-now element of the collection get the headlines. So can we expect the same no show tonight? Only time will tell… Sir Philip Green with Kate Moss at the 2013 British Fashion Awards Credit: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock 5:59PM Dame Natalie Massenet opens the 2016 Fashion Awards... Proving we've come a long way from the very first British Fashion Awards in 1989 I t seems only appropriate that Dame Natalie Massenet - chairman of the British Fashion Council and the woman who changed the way we all shop when she founded Net-a-Porter - is first to take to the red carpet at the 2016 Fashion Awards. Accompanied by the British Fashion Council's CEO, Caroline Rush, and Nadja Swarovski the trio mark a glamorous start to the ceremony that's been rebranded this year. @nat_mass, @nadja.swarovski & @97crush open the #FashionAwards 2016 red carpet #Swarovski A photo posted by British Fashion Council (@britishfashioncouncil) on Dec 5, 2016 at 9:49am PST T he intention is to turn the 2016 Awards - which are sponsored by Swarovski - into an international showcase, with ambitions to rival the starry, Anna Wintour-run annual Met Gala in aid of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in New York. As such, they have worked hard to attract A-list heavyweights to the event, including Bella and Gigi Hadid, the supermodel sisters who are up against each other in the Model of the Year category . But while the supermodel pair might have dominated the news agenda thus far, they were but twinkles in their parents' eyes when the very first British Fashion Awards took place in 1989. Princess Diana presenting Hardy Amies with an award at the first iteration of the British Fashion Awards Credit: REX N aturally, it was a glamorous affair from the off. Princess Diana was guest of honour, presenting Hardy Amies with the British Fashion Council's Hall of Fame award. The evening saw the debut of what became known as Diana's 'Elvis' outfit- a white strapless dress which came with a matching bolero jacket with a collar resembling the raised styles once made famous by Presley himself. It was created by Catherine Walker, the British designer who Diana relied upon from as early as 1981 for appropriate yet glamorous looks for her public engagements. With her slicked-back hair, Diana was working the on the-cusp-of-the-90s looks to perfection. Princess Diana in 1989 at the first British Fashion Awards Credit: Eddie Boldizsar/REX/Shutterstock T here were just 7 awards presented at that first ceremony, versus the 14 we're expecting tonight. Some things never change though; Naomi Campbell was pictured smiling with designer Rifat Ozbek and posing in a Lakers cap at those first awards. She’s set to present an award tonight too, and no doubt she'll make just as much of a style statement as she did 27 years ago.

To Little House in Mayfair first for a brunch 'do. Alexa Chung and Naomi Campbell both opted for the suitably nonchalant yet pulled together combination of jeans and a blazer. Naomi Campbell at the nominees lunch hosted by the British Fashion council at Soho House Credit: Getty C hung's cream tailored jacket is by niche label Blaze (one to bookmark if you have money to invest in something which feels special but which you'll use for ever) while Campbell's pepto-bismol pink velvet number has a proper party feel, especially paired with a skinny scarf. Alexa Chung was wearing Blaze - a label to bookmark Credit: Getty T he tailoring theme continued later in the day as M'oda Operandi hosted an evening shindig. The suit was confirmed as the ageless answer for elegant evening dressing as Mary McCartney, 47, and Maye Musk, 69, both looked fabulous in their tailored two-pieces. Laura Bailey meanwhile enlivened her timeless Chanel tweed jacket with a pop-art t-shirt. Maye Musk proved that a tuxedo is the secret to timeless style Credit: Getty A nna Wintour wrapped up against the December chill in a striped coat and brocade dress. And two women at the helm of the BFC and The Fashion Awards showed their support for Brit talent; British Fashion Council CEO Caroline Rush showcased a vibrant Roksanda dress while Dame Natalie Massenet was in an Erdem skirt. Anna Wintour didn't shy away from a statement coat at the chilly nominees lunch hosted by the British Fashion Council.

The "" Bal des Ardents "" ( ""Burning Men's Ball"" ) was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a Bal des sauvages ( ""Wild Men's Ball"" ), a form of costumed ball ( morisco ). It took place in celebration of the marriage of a lady-in-waiting of Charles VI of France 's queen in Paris on January 28, 1393. The King and five courtiers dressed as wildmen of the woods ( woodwoses ), with costumes of flax and pitch . When they came too close to a torch, the dancers caught fire. (This episode may have influenced Edgar Allan Poe 's short story "" Hop-Frog "".) Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the ducal court of Burgundy . Masquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance (Italian, maschera ). They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in Venice . They have been associated with the tradition of the Venetian Carnival . With the fall of the Venetian Republic at the end of the 18th century, the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline, until they disappeared altogether. Masquerade ball at Château de Hattonchâtel , France . They became popular throughout mainland Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes with fatal results. Gustav III of Sweden was assassinated at a masquerade ball by disgruntled nobleman Jacob Johan Anckarström , an event which Eugène Scribe and Daniel Auber turned into the opera Gustave III . The same event was the basis of Giuseppe Verdi 's opera A Masked Ball , although the censors in the original production forced him to portray it as a fictional story set in Boston. Most masks came from countries like Switzerland and Italy. John James Heidegger , a Swiss count who arrived in Italy in 1708, is credited with having introduced the Venetian fashion of a semi-public masquerade ball, to which one might subscribe, to London in the early eighteenth century, with the first being held at Haymarket Opera House . [1] London's public gardens, like Vauxhall Gardens , refurbished in 1732, and Ranelagh Gardens , provided optimal outdoor settings, where characters masked and in fancy dress mingled with the crowds. The reputation for unseemly behavior, unescorted women and assignations motivated a change of name, to the Venetian ridotto but as ""The Man of Taste"" observed in 1733; In Lent, if masquerades displease the town, Call 'em Ridottos and they still go down."" A standard item of masquerade dress was a ""Vandyke"", improvised on the costumes worn in the portraits of Van Dyck : Gainsborough's Blue Boy is the most familiar example, and a reminder of the later 18th-century popularity in England for portraits in fancy dress. Throughout the century, masquerade dances became popular in Colonial America . Its prominence did not go unchallenged; a significant anti-masquerade movement grew alongside the balls themselves. The anti-masquerade writers (among them such notables as Samuel Richardson ) held that the events encouraged immorality and ""foreign influence."" While they were sometimes able to persuade authorities to their views, particularly after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, enforcement of measures designed to end masquerades was at best desultory, and the masquerades went on as semi-private ""subscriptions."" [2] In the 1770s, fashionable Londoners went to the masquerades organized by Teresa Cornelys at Carlisle House in Soho Square , and later to the Pantheon . Masquerade balls were sometimes set as a game among the guests. The masked guests were supposedly dressed so as to be unidentifiable. This would create a type of game to see if a guest could determine each other's identities. This added a humorous effect to many masquerades and enabled a more enjoyable version of typical balls. One of the most noted masquerade balls of the 20th century was that held at Palazzo Labia in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by Carlos de Beistegui . It was dubbed ""the party of the century."" Contemporary revival [ edit ] A new resurgence of masquerade balls began in the late 1990s in North America. More recently, the party atmosphere is emphasized and the formal dancing usually less prominent. Less formal "" costume parties "" may be a descendant of this tradition. Cultural references [ edit ] The picturesque quality of the masquerade ball has made it a favorite topic or setting in literature . Edgar Allan Poe 's short story "" The Masque of the Red Death "" is based at a masquerade ball in which a central figure turns out to be his costume. Another ball in Zürich is featured in the novel Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse . A masquerade ball is central to the plot of Mikhail Lermontov 's 1835 play Masquerade . The play was censored and never staged during Lermontov's lifetime, partly because of the implied criticism of the masquerade balls staged by the aristocratic Engelhardt family . The book, musical and most film adaptations of The Phantom of the Opera have a scene at a masked ball. The Phantom's (Erik's) costume is that of the Red Death from the aforementioned Edgar Allan Poe story The Masque of the Red Death . In the play Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare , Romeo meets Juliet at a masquerade ball. The video game "" Dishonored "" has a mission called Lady Boyle's Last Party, taking place at a masquerade where the primary objective is discerning the identity of Lady Boyle, a masked party-goer. Ubisoft Game Assassins Creed II has a pivotal story line centred around a venetian masquerade. TV [ edit ] In the 2003, The Haunted Mansion filmed a masquerade ball scene.

Have you ever worn an outfit that feels “so you”? This is because clothing is more than just fabric and cloth. All the textures, colors, and details represent who we are and what we want in our lives. Take a moment to think about what is it specifically you are looking to attract. Is it to be more creative? To get more focused? Or, are you looking to land a better job? Feng Shui , the ancient Chinese method of arranging and decorating your home for happiness, health and prosperity, can also be applied to your wardrobe! You can use your clothing to attract your deepest desires, helping you to transform into who you were meant to be. In Feng Shui, the 5 elements – water, wood, fire, earth, and metal – work together to achieve balance. Each element represents a different archetype and different life intentions. When we apply these elements to fashion, we can wear specific clothing to support our intentions. Below is easy to follow guide of the archeptypes of each element, what that means, and how to dress the part. The more mindful you become with your wardrobe on a consistent basis, the sooner you will transcend all limitations and enhance the life you love. Be creative with your wardrobe, have fun, and get ready to rock your new look! Water “The Philosopher” Intention: If you desire to be more creative, expressive, contemplative, spiritual, or free. What to wear? Clothing with asymmetrical patterns, dark colors fabrics, flowing shapes, sheer fabrics, or anything with a wavy pattern. Wood “The Pioneer” Intentions: If you want to take more action, bring more focus (physical or mental), get clarity, commit to something, or achieve the “getting down to business” mentality. What to wear? Wood is all about plants, flowers, natural materials and anything that allows you to move, so that you are not constricted. Choose clothing like denim, t-shirts, linen shirts, blue or green colors, corduroy, floral patterns, or something with stripes. Fire “The Pleasure Seeker” Intentions: Brings more excitement, fun, passion, fame, or romance into your life. What to wear? Clothing with animal prints that are sexy, red or purple, or bright colors. Also, clothing made of patent leather or just leather, and clothes that flaunt your beautiful femininity. Earth “The Peacemaker” Intentions: We need earth when we are looking to be balanced. Earth brings in more grounding, balance, harmony, compassion, and nurturing into your life. What to wear? Clothing that is designed in the earth tone colors like beige, brown, camels, mustard etc. Pieces that are made of square patterns, like flannels. Lastly, clothing with textures that are warm and cozy and that you can be comfortable in. Metal “The Perfectionist” Intentions: All about refinement, culture, elegance, completion sophistication, or to become more organized, What to wear? Clothing in whites, metallics, and pastels. Patterns in clothing will be arched or rounded. Typically, clothing in this range is the more expensive/luxurious fabrics like silk and satin. Craving more?

16," Fashion - Wikipedia Fashion From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Fashion (disambiguation) . ""Menswear"" redirects here. For the musical group, see Menswear (band) . In Following the Fashion (1794), James Gillray caricatured a figure flattered by the short- bodiced gowns then in fashion, contrasting it with an imitator whose figure is not flattered. Fashion Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing , footwear , accessories , makeup , body , or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often constant trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers. [1] Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term ""fashion"", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while ""fashion"" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous .

The Japanese Shogun 's secretary bragged (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years. [4] However, there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing . [5] Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change, as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate , followed by a long period without major changes. In 8th-century Moorish Spain , the musician Ziryab introduced to Córdoba [6] [ unreliable source ] [7] sophisticated clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad , modified by his own inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks , who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East . [8] The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated. Historians, including James Laver and Fernand Braudel , date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the 14th century , [9] [10] though it should be noted that they tend to rely heavily on contemporary imagery [11] and illuminated manuscripts were not common before the fourteenth century. The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf -length to barely covering the buttocks , [12] sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger. This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers. The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. Art historians are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from Ancien Régime France . [13] Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of early modern Europe led to the bourgeoisie and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion. [14] Albrecht Dürer 's drawing contrasts a well turned out bourgeoise from Nuremberg (left) with her counterpart from Venice . The Venetian lady's high chopines make her look taller. In the 16th century, national differences were at their most pronounced. Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats. Albrecht Dürer illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century ( illustration, right ). The ""Spanish style"" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century. [15] Though textile colors and patterns changed from year to year, [16] the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were largely derived from military models, and changes in a European male Silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the ""Steinkirk"" cravat or necktie . Marie Antoinette , wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion. Her choices, such as this 1783 white muslin dress called a chemise a la Reine , were highly influential and widely worn. [17] Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s, the pace of change picked up in the 1780s with increased publication of French engravings illustrating the latest Paris styles. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant. [18] Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry certainly led many trends, the history of fashion design is normally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born Charles Frederick Worth opened the first true haute couture house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry. These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers. [19] Since then, the idea of the fashion designer as a celebrity in his or her own right has become increasingly dominant. [20] The idea of unisex dressing originated in the 1960s when designers such as Pierre Cardin and Rudi Gernreich created garments, such as stretch jersey tunics or leggings, meant to be worn by both males and females. The impact of unisex expands more broadly to encompass various themes in fashion including androgyny, mass-market retail, and conceptual clothing. [21] The fashion trends of the 1970s, such as sheepskin jackets, flight jackets, duffel coats, and unstructured clothing influenced men to attend social gatherings without a tuxedo jacket and to accessorize in new ways. Some men's styles blended the sensuality and expressiveness despite the conservative trend, the growing gay-rights movement and an emphasis on youth allowed for a new freedom to experiment with style, fabrics such as wool crepe, which had previously been associated with women's attire was used by designers when creating male clothing. [22] The four major current fashion capitals are acknowledged to be Paris , Milan , New York City , and London , which are all headquarters to the greatest fashion companies and are renowned for their major influence on global fashion. Fashion weeks are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences. A succession of major designers such as Coco Chanel and Yves Saint-Laurent have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although haute couture is now subsidized by the sale of ready-to-wear collections and perfume using the same branding . Modern Westerners have a wide number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural status start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their personal style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age , social class , generation , occupation , and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms fashionista and fashion victim refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions. One can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of Roland Barthes .) In recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their own ideas. [23] Fashion industry [ edit ] Fashion model on the runaway, Romantika Fashion, Sofia, Bulgaria Main article: Clothing industry The notion of a global fashion industry is a product of the modern age. [24] Prior to the mid-19th century, most clothing was custom-made . It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century—with the rise of new technologies such as the sewing machine , the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores—clothing had increasingly come to be mass-produced in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices. Although the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, as of 2015 [update] , it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold world-wide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam , finished in Italy , and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States, [25] and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for world production of textiles and clothing are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output. [26] The fashion industry consists of four levels: the production of raw materials, principally fibers and textiles but also leather and fur . the production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others. retail sales various forms of advertising and promotion These levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors. These sectors are Textile Design and Production, Fashion Design and Manufacturing, Fashion Retailing, Marketing and Merchandising, Fashion Shows , and Media and Marketing. Each sector is devoted to the goal of satisfying consumer demand for apparel under conditions that enable participants in the industry to operate at a profit. [27] Fashion trend [ edit ] Iris van Herpen 3D printing technology Fashion trends are influenced by several factors including political, economical, social and technological. Examining these factors is called a PEST analysis. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine growth or decline of a particular trend. Political influences [ edit ] Political culture plays a critical role in fashion industry. Political change is reflection of today's fashion. Most of the political events and laws are affecting fashion in a way of creating fashion trend. Considering the relationship between fashion and politics, we can see how fashion is not only a matter of aesthetic but it involves politics as well. Within political references, we can see how fashion can change. Fashion is a reflection of current or historical events therefore it associates with today and past ‘s politics. For example, the terrorist attacks happened in the United States on September 11, 2001; it was the most tragic political events of the society. This catastrophic event caused horrific consequences which related to political. In a way, fashion trends were also revolutionised. It is hard to say that 9/11 attacks made a direct influence on fashion industry, it should not be considered as inspiration for fashion designer to forecast the trend. However, after 9/11, fashion designers decided to embrace this challenge and tried to convey the significant lost and depression into a form of fashion trend. In a way, they believe that nation would remember this event more often and cherish every single moment we have. Post 9/11 led comfort dressing to remember and grieve the attacks on 9/11. By doing so, this trend became a form of communication. Not only did political events make a huge impact on fashion trends but also the political figure played a critical role in forecasting the fashion trend. For example, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress or a soft color Cassini coat with huge buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend. Furthermore, political revolution also made impact on fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s the economy had become wealthier, divorce rate was increasing and government approved the birth control pill . This revolution inspired younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring miniskirt has become a major fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s. Moreover, political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trend. For instance, during Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie and it is still affecting current fashion trend. [28] Technology influences [ edit ] Technology plays a large role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends. Developments such as wearable technology has become an important trend in fashion and will continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and smart fabrics that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes. [29] The fashion industry is seeing how 3D printing technology has influenced designers such as Iris Van Herpen and Kimberly Ovitz . These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely. Internet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed and sold immediately. Styles and trends are easily conveyed online to attract the trendsetters. Posts on Instagram or Facebook can easily increase awareness about new trends in fashion which can create high demand for specific items or brands, [30] new ""buy now button"" technology can link these styles with direct sales. Machine vision technology has been developed to track how fashions spread through society. The industry can now see the direct correlation on how fashion shows influence street-chic outfits. The effects can now be quantified and provide valuable feedback to fashion houses, designers and consumers regarding trends. [31] Military technology has played an important role in the fashion industry. The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personal be less visible to enemy forces. A trend emerged in the 1960s and camouflage fabric was introduced to street wear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s. [32] Designers such as Valentino, Dior and Dolce & Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections. A company called Hyperstealth has said to have created a technology that can make an object or person invisible. ""Quantum Stealth"" is a light bending technology and can mask thermal and infrared signs. The company has continued developing this technology, but due to safety and legal concerns minimal information has been released to the public. [33] This technology will not be quickly introduced into the commercial market, but the companies other projects such as non-powered color changing camouflage materials may be. Additional projects such as using interactive or intelligent technology sources that will be embedding into textiles will adjust to surroundings such as weather. [34] As these developments proceed, consumers may see a more modern and technical way of wearing camouflage. These are just a few technological developments that have begun to influence fashion trends. Fashion trend is influenced by different factors and incidents happening in our environment. Art, music, and popular culture influence fashion trend and how its penetrate into our everyday lives. High end fashion is more creative, while high street fashion is more commercial. However, both high end and high street fashion reflect trends that are happening in our society as a whole. Fashion trends are both aesthetic and expressive values that showcase our personal statement. Social influences [ edit ] The relationship between the body and fashion is central to promoting particular values about the self to society. People use fashion as a way of assigning themselves into different values held by a particular group of people within a given society. [35] Fashion trend goes beyond the aesthetic values, it emerges as an expressive tool for designers to deliver their message about the society. With the influence of social media, celebrities and bloggers, their voice are easily being heard and have impact on fashion and trend at any time. Fashion and music are inseparable. Prabal Gurung [36] highlighted the importance of music to his shows, saying ""each season we want to tell a story for 10 minutes…. the perfect harmony between cloths and music allows this"". Music is a representation of fashion that expresses the abstract design concept into relatable harmony for viewers. H&M work with the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival to develop a clothing collection. From the success of its first collaboration at 2015, which gives confidence for the brand to continuous launch this collection again this year. At Coachella, fashion and music express an energy that belongs to the festival and music goers. The collective trend and style that symbolize the energy and personality. Fashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika, [37] ""Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music…like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives."" Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video ‘Formation’ by Beyoncé, according to Carlos, [38] ""The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyoncé catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day."" Runway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway show is a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water, [39] ""where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet."" Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like ""Feminist but feminine"" and ""Ladies first."" According to Water, [39] ""The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour."" Minimalist fashion [ edit ] ""Less is more."" is the main idea of minimalist fashion. Minimalism is a philosophy of dressing that has endured for decades, and is probably best recognized today by the general public through the fashion houses of Jil Sander , Balenciaga , and Calvin Klein . Calvin Klein really has captured the minimalist movement in America during the 1990s. While the clothes are simple and have a reduction on color pallet, there is a very sexual and grunge feel to his designs. Simple, function, and original are the key components to describe minimalism. Clean lines, functionality have always been hallmarks of the style. It depends as the mainstream fashion of 90s, Calvin Klein is a well-known examples for minimalistic style. They create easy clothes for modern women which use executed cut to emphasize shape and neutral color are the major color tone. 90s fashion has re-emerged the black and white palette prevalently as a defining duo on today's runways. The all-white look is another 90s favorite look which is impacting a rise in neutrals in today's fashion as well. Minimalism is also a catalyst for the rise of activewear influences. This trend introduces the bandeau and sports bra tops, bomber jackets and racerback details in high fashion collections during that era and it returns to runways and streets today. Sheer is a key material during the minimalist movement. It emerges in a wide range of applications, from an overlay to a full garment. The trend for transparency keeps to continue as a focus of designer collections every since then. Besides sheer fabrics, metallic materials also bring the interest to the sparse shapes of the era. It is a trend that reflects in the rave culture and bridging the grunge musician and the fans. Reflective has returned on recent runway and also on current streets with a range of metal. Crop top is the most democratic garment that connecting the movements of minimalist, grunge , hip-hop and R&B culture and turning up on everyone from Mariah Carey and Spice Girls to the top fashion icons. Another defining looks to emerge from minimalist era is the idea of underwear as outerwear. Camisoles and slip dresses were introduced to the market and it became a quintessential of the 90s in contemporary fashion. Minimalism style is much more than a trend, it becomes a zeitgeist. Designers such as Stella McCartney follows the suit with pragmatic tailoring in neutral palettes, Alexander Wang starts to show pared-down activewear in black, white and grey. Even Victoria Beckham turns to strict silhouettes from the bling wave. Minimalism never goes away. Shapes are plain, femininity is the leader, Color and sculpted shapes speak louder than extra decorative accessories. Economical influences [ edit ] Circular economy [ edit ] As we undergo a global economic downturn, the ""Spend now, think later"" belief is getting less relevant in our society. [40] Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society. They're looking for ways to mediate their material desires with an aim to do more good in the world. A linear economy is slowly shifting to a circular one. In today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the circular model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company ""represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,"" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay €7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud, trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period. [40] Another ethical fashion company, Patagonia set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's ""Used Gear"" section. [40] China's domestic spending [ edit ] Consumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce tariffs on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption. [41] The announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes — easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities. [41] According to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped. [42] There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase. Consumer's needs [ edit ] In fashion trends and forecasting, consumer is king. What does a consumer really want ? Understanding the consumer is a vital part of the fashion world, without them products cannot be sold. First, it is important to note the difference between a consumer's needs and a consumer's wants. A need of a consumer is a desire to obtain a product or service, that is either for an emotional or functional reason. A ‘want’ differs from a consumer's ‘need’ by the consumer's desire to have a product or service that is not necessary, the consumer just wishes they had it. [43] The success of a fashion company and the prediction of future trends is dependent on addressing its consumers’ needs. Consumers all have different needs and demands that have to be suited. A person's needs change frequently, which is why fashion trends even exist. An important factor to take into consideration when thinking of consumers’ needs is the key demographics of the customer. Gender, age, income, and even profession can help a company better understand the needs of their customers. [44] For example, a woman who is pregnant could be looking for diapers, baby strollers, and maternity clothes. Her needs would differ greatly from a woman with children that just went off to college or a teen entering high school. Often consumers need to be told what they want. Fashion companies have to do their research to ensure they know its customers’ needs before developing solutions. Steve Jobs said, ""You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You cannot start with the technology and try to figure out where you are going to sell it"". [45] The best way to understand the consumers’ needs and therefore predict fashion trends is through market research . There are two research methods: primary and secondary. [46] Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Benefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions. Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group. [46] Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants. Knowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies’ sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers’ lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for. Media [ edit ] The media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is fashion journalism . Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, [47] Social network , and fashion blogs . In recent years, fashion blogging and YouTube videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible. [48] At the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past. In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty . Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was La Gazette du Bon Ton , which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years). [ citation needed ] Vogue , founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after World War II and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of Vogue' s popularity is the younger version, Teen Vogue , which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the ""fashionista on a budget"". Haute couture designers followed the trend by starting ready-to-wear and perfume lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: Fashion Theory (1997) and Vestoj (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as Fashion Television started to appear. FashionTV was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. However, over the past several years, fashion websites have developed that merge traditional editorial writing with user-generated content . Online magazines like iFashion Network and Runway Magazine , led by Nole Marin from America's Next Top Model , have begun to dominate the market with digital copies for computers, iPhones , and iPads . Example platforms include Apple and Android for such applications. A few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, The New Islander ' s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. ""Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as Vogue always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January"", she writes. ""Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying."" [49] The fashion industry has been the subject of numerous films and television shows, including the reality show Project Runway and the drama series Ugly Betty . Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as product placement opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion. [50] Videos in general have been very useful in promoting the fashion industry. This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements. Public relations and social media [ edit ] Fashion public relations involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company. [51] Social media plays an important role in modern-day fashion public relations; enabling practitioners to reach a wide range of consumers through various platforms. Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public relations. In some cases, great hype is built about new designers' collections before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure generated by practitioners. [52] Social media, such as blogs, micro blogs, podcasts, photo and video sharing sites have all become increasingly important to fashion public relations. [53] The interactive nature of these platforms allows practitioners to engage and communicate with publics in real time, and tailor their clients’ brand or campaign messages to the target audience. With blogging platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr, Wordpress, and other sharing sites, bloggers have emerged as expert fashion commentators, shaping brands and having a great impact on what is ‘on trend’. [54] Women in the fashion public relations industry such as Sweaty Betty PR founder Roxy Jacenko and Oscar de la Renta's PR girl Erika Bearman, have acquired copious amounts of followers on their social media sites, by providing a brand identity and a behind the scenes look into the companies they work for. Social media is changing the way practitioners deliver messages, [12] as they are concerned with the media, and also customer relationship building. [55] PR practitioners must provide effective communication among all platforms, in order to engage fashion publics in an industry socially connected via online shopping. [56] Consumers have the ability to share their purchases on their personal social media pages (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), and if practitioners deliver the brand message effectively and meet the needs of its publics, word-of-mouth publicity will be generated and potentially provide a wide reach for the designer and their products. Anthropological perspective [ edit ] Anthropology , the study of culture and human societies, studies fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially appropriate and others are not. A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion. [57] According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred. [58] The definition of fashion and anti-fashion is as follows: Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time. Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little. Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion. Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season. Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style. [59] Today, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion. People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of Nike shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering [ clarification needed ] . Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits. [60] The change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia . The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people. Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class. People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles. Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages. [61] In eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization. In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others. Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with colonialism . Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses. This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods. [62] The use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion. [63] Intellectual property [ edit ] In the fashion industry, intellectual property is not enforced as it is within the film industry and music industry . Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA [ which? ] that ""Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places."" [ citation needed ] To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, WGSN has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies. Since fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag. In 2005, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries. [64] [65] Political activism [ edit ] Fashion may be used to promote a cause, such as to promote healthy behavior, [66] to raise money for a cancer cure , [67] or to raise money for local charities [68] such as the Juvenile Protective Association [69] or a children's hospice . [70] One up-and-coming fashion cause is trashion , which is using trash to make clothes, jewelery, and other fashion items in order to promote awareness of pollution. There are a number of modern trashion artists such as Marina DeBris , Ann Wizer, [71] and Nancy Judd. [72] Fashion has come a long way and the fashion industry has been broadened to include cultural fashions as well as different platforms for designers to showcase their work. Indigenous Fashion Week in Australia, for example, has been created and introduced to the public as a way for indigenous designers to embrace their cultural and traditional clothing and create new trends in fashion to share with the world.

Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption The covering of hair in public has been compulsory for women in Iran since 1979 Twelve people involved in the fashion industry in Iran are reported to have been jailed for ""spreading prostitution"" via images posted online. The eight women and four men were handed sentences of between five months and six years by a court in Shiraz, a lawyer told the Ilna news agency. They were also banned from working in fashion and travelling abroad for two years afterwards, Mahmoud Taravat said. He added that his clients had denied the charges and planned to appeal. Why 'SpongeBob' trousers furore is troubling Iran Couple leave Iran after posting 'un-Islamic' photos Iran arrests 'un-Islamic' online models The 12 were convicted of charges including spreading prostitution and promoting corruption via the publication of obscene images online, inciting Muslims to corrupt themselves through putting on fashion shows, and spreading a ""Western-style culture of nudity"". They were not named by Mr Taravat in his interview with Ilna. But he said they included a man given a six-year sentence and banned from working in journalism or government service for two years following his release; a woman and a man jailed for five years and banned from working in fashion design; and a man jailed for two years and banned from working in photography. Iran's judiciary launched a crackdown on ""un-Islamic"" behaviour by fashion models earlier this year. In May, the prosecutor of Tehran's cybercrimes court announced the arrest of eight people involved in posting photographs of women without headscarves on social media. Iranian law requires that all women cover their hair in public. They were among 170 models, photographers, make-up artists, salon managers and designers identified as being involved in online modelling.

Early 2010s (2010–13) [ edit ] Chinese woman wearing brightly colored 1980s-inspired dress, 2013. 1980s influences [ edit ] The early 2010s saw many recycled fashions from the 1950s , [19] 1970s and 1980s as designers from stores like Topshop replicated original vintage clothing . In the United States, it was popular to wear Gucci , Chanel , or Versace designer clothing, and neon colors such as pink, green, teal, black, purple, magenta and yellow. [20] Popular tops for American, British and Australian women aged 20–50 included tunics , 1980s style baseball jackets , [21] oversized cardigans , western shirts , 2fer and layered shirts and tees, dresses and shirts worn with belts, Perfecto motorcycle jackets customized with studs , [22] floral camisoles worn with matching boyshorts , and sundresses . European women wear sparkly dresses, baggy one-size-fits-all Empire line skirts, blouses and dresses, and lace, figure-hugging white organza maxi dresses inspired by Pippa Middleton . [23] From 2010 to 2013 many late 2000s fashion trends remained popular in Europe, the United States, East Asia, Israel, and South America, especially acid wash skinny jeans , ""trouser-dresses"", romper suits , [24] [25] preppy pastel colored skinny jeans, metallic dresses, [26] and capri pants cropped at the ankle. Possibly due to the poor economy in the early years, the midi skirt and the maxi skirt were the most common skirt and dress styles, with the hemline standards being the longest they had been since The Great Depression . [27] Tribal fashions and 1990s revival [ edit ] From late 2012 onward, 1990s inspired fashion began to make a comeback in the UK, USA, Philippines, India, and Australasia among women aged 18–30. [28] Popular upper apparel included ugly sweaters , [29] khaki superdry trenchcoats , [30] T-shirts with blazers , plaid, [31] oversized flannel shirts worn or tied around the waist, oversized T-shirts, padded gilets , [32] Penshoppe skater skirts (in the Philippines), skorts , crew neck sweaters , destroyed acid wash Balmain jeans, [33] [34] and crop tops . [31] [35] In the UK and the US, popular bottom apparel includes skinny jeans, leggings, parachute pants , [31] railroad stripe pants or skirts, [36] boyfriend jeans, and high-waisted shorts . Desirable footwear from 2012-15 included Hunter boots brand rain boots, flat sandals, stilettos , Keds worn in ads by Mischa Barton, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift, TOMS Shoes , Chucks , Sperry top-siders boat shoes , flat knee high riding boots , Uggs , moccasins , Hunter boots brand rain boots, one strap sandals, [37] [38] furry slip-on Puma sandals, [39] Ballerina flats , cavalier boots , [40] gladiator sandals , wedge heel -style sneakers, flip-flops , combat boots , [31] Doc Martens , and The Timberland Company hiking boots. Other popular trends of the early and mid 2010s included Aztec and Navajo inspired patterns featuring diamonds and triangles, especially on T shirts, socks, handbags, panties, pullovers, and other knitwear. [41] In addition, young American women began wearing feather earrings, beaded bracelets, sneakers resembling moccasins , [42] ponchos , vests and jackets made from striped Mexican blanket material, despite the connotations of cultural appropriation . [43] These tribal inspired garments, made popular by Urban Outfitters and Ralph Lauren , typically came in bright colors like red, yellow, turquoise, blue, and orange. [44] Eastern fashions and carry-over styles [ edit ] Many fashion trends from the early years of the decade, especially the 80s influences and the 1960s inspired indie, neo-hippie and boho chic looks, remained relevant in the US and Europe as far as 2015. This included skinny jeans , tunics , floral print dresses, midi and maxi skirts , motorcycle jackets, western shirts , red and blue geometric print blouses, patterned and solid colored tights , overalls , [45] jogger pants, [46] flat boots, stiletto shoes , high waisted short shorts , [47] Nike Tempo shorts , pastel and neon colored shorts, ballet flats , and combat boots. Popular colors from 2015-16 included mauve, cream, eggplant, lime green, and warm grey. [48] Continuing on from the late 2000s, Fashion in India moved away from traditional clothes like the saree [49] and glamorous Bollywood style dresses in favor of a more Westernized style that incorporated navy pants, blazers , leather jackets , waistcoats and androgynous military jackets. [50] Popular casual footwear included leather dress boots , stiletto heels, platform sandals, and open toe pumps. [51] Cream, grey, blue and orange Kurta dresses with side slits [52] decorated with pink or purple embroidery and synthetic jewels were worn with jeans or leggings, T shirts , tank tops and bat wing sleeve blouses were paired with traditional silk salwar pajamas [53] or short shorts, and the large hoop earrings declined in popularity in favor of smaller minimalist gold jewelery. In the US, some very daring [54] women wore kurta dresses of this type completely bottomless , [55] most notably reality TV star Kendall Jenner in 2013. [56] Mid 2010s (2014-16) [ edit ] Monochromatic and printed clothing [ edit ] The A-line dress made a comeback in 2014. Hemlines also became shorter than they were in the early 2010s. By the mid 2010s neon colors were out of style in Europe, America and Australasia, and they were replaced by black, white, various shades of gray , [57] and charcoal first on the catwalk , and later as street fashion. [58] Black and white (sometimes red) [59] Polka dot blouses [60] and dresses underwent a revival in China and North Korea [61] in addition to chunky 90s inspired platform heels . [62] [63] This trend had spread to Middle Eastern countries like Turkey , Iran and the United Arab Emirates by 2016, [64] with Italian brand Dolce and Gabbana launching a range of black and white hijabs and abayas decorated with lace daisies, roses and lemons. [65] Monochromatic clothing trends of 2014 and early 2015 included black and white lace dresses, [66] lace blouses , [67] jackets and dresses with peter pan collars , blazers , black or nude slip dresses, T shirt dresses, white babydoll dresses, bodycon midi dresses, [68] [69] [70] black and white striped "" Beetlejuice "" style slim-fit pants , [71] long black velvet blazers decorated with silver braid, tuxedo jackets (often having contrasting black velvet or satin lapels), [72] crop tops , [73] [74] oversized coats, [58] striped culottes , loose Capri pants and palazzo pants , [75] [76] patent leather gladiator sandals , romper suits , puffer jackets and vests, [77] knee-length skirts, [78] pencil skirts , [79] [80] black and white geometric printed leggings, and cuffed boyfriend jeans . [58] Denim declined in popularity in the US, [81] with black or grey yoga pants , leggings, and slim-fit fashionable jogger pants replacing them. [82] Costume jewelry, Onesies and Snuggies [ edit ] Loom bands , bracelets woven from brightly colored rubber bands , were seen as both a global fashion statement and a children's fad. [83] In France and America, 1990s inspired Choker necklaces featuring colored glass beads, silver chain link, artificial diamonds, Swarovski crystals, lace, velvet, and black or red leather had returned to popularity. [84] By 2016, Chokers were also worn as an attachment to dresses and shirts, as a high-neck style and with shoulders exposed also known as ""cold shoulder"". [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] Other brief fads of the mid 2010s included snuggie sleeved blankets and the unisex onesie suit . [94] Originally envisioned as pajamas , onesies were often purchased as a gag gift, [95] and worn as casual streetwear [96] by some younger women in the UK, Australia, [97] and the US, including Amy Childs , Kourtney Kardashian , [98] and Holly Carpenter . [99] 1970s revival [ edit ] Beginning in summer 2016, there has been a revival of 70s fashion in the US, UK, and France, notably of bell bottom style pants, lace-up tops, crocheted crop tops, sweaters and halternecks , [100] and Bardot off the shoulder tops. [101] [102] [103] [104] The lace up trend is also highly popular with footwear, largely because of Tunisian shoe designer Azzedine Alaia . [105] [106] In America, women favor white, black, camel, warm grey , or blush sweater dresses, thin turtlenecks popularised by The Kardashians , [107] catsuits , jumpsuits , playsuits or rompers , [108] [109] high necked Victorian inspired lace dresses, [110] and leather, tan or olive green duster coats . [111] [112] Solid wedge heels , Stuart Weitzman knee boots , platform shoes and perspex heels, also known as the ""nothing shoe"" became a popular trend in 2016. [113] [114] By autumn 2016, the brightly colored beige, red, green, brown and orange 70s revival fashions began to replace the grey and monochromatic 90s inspired streetwear in Britain and France. Particularly popular were the sheepskin coats, peacoats, brown granny boots, slightly flared jeans, [115] loosely woven plaid blouses, pleats, ruffles, stripes, mandarin collar tops, oversized paisley , suede or black vinyl handbags, embroidered long sleeve T shirts, throws, wraps, ponchos, fur lined parkas , floral minidresses, leather safari blazers, cold shoulder tops, peasant blouses, fur vests, denim shirt dresses , hot pants , tunics, ghillies , Grecian sandals , and red, white, salmon, lavender or orange crocheted jumpers. [116] [117] [118] Unlike the original 70s garments, however, shirts and tops continued to have relatively small collars. [119] [120] The pantywaist tops previously fashionable as sportswear in the late 70s and early 80s, started to commonly replace T shirts in the UK, US and South Africa, especially among pop stars and models like Candice Swanepoel , Emily Ratajkowski , [121] Nicki Minaj , and Beyoncé , whose one-off bodysuits were modified from vintage Adidas and Chicago Bulls jerseys. [122] [123] Men's clothing [ edit ] Early 2010s (2010–12) [ edit ] Popular 2010's rapper Kendrick Lamar in 2012 Neon colors [ edit ] Neon colors and elaborate T-shirts were popular for much of the early 2010s, especially graphic print hoodies , novelty socks, red or blue skinny jeans , studded belts with large buckles, and Ed Hardy T-shirts embellished with rhinestones . [124] Many styles from the late 2000s remained fashionable in Europe, Australasia, and the Americas, with brands such as Polo Ralph Lauren and J Crew being well favored. [125] Popular tops for men aged 20–50 included shawl collar cardigans , [126] V-neck T-shirts, acid wash denim work shirts, [127] cable knit pullovers , [128] Tartan flannel Western shirts with snap fastenings , grunge style padded tartan overshirts in red, navy blue or dark green, [129] throwback basketball or baseball uniforms , [129] denim jackets, [130] Aloha shirts , car coats , [131] 1930s style linen sportcoats , brown or black brogues , [132] and black leather jackets like the Schott Perfecto motorcycle jacket . [133] 1990s revival [ edit ] In the summer of 2012, early 1990s inspired fashion made a comeback in the UK among men. This included bright colored short shorts, jeans shorts with a stone wash or acid wash , shirts with Aztec patterns, Mayan patterns, camouflage prints or animal prints, flannel shirts, high top sneakers , snapback hats , and gaudy wristwatches . [134] In America, the trend caught on in 2013. The Grunge look had made a comeback due to the influence of Steves Peeps , an artist from Boston . [135] [136] Common upper items of clothing include bomber jackets , black leather jackets, crombie overcoats, padded tartan overshirts , crewneck sweatshirts , [137] oversized flannel shirts, throwback basketball or baseball uniforms , and preppy Nantucket Reds . Other popular accessories of the early 2010s included Doc Martens , The Timberland Company , combat boots , Converse All Stars , Sperry Top-Siders , Ugg boots , Nike Elite crew socks, snapback hats inspired by artists like Mac Miller , brown Oxford shoes , and classic Nike trainers. [138] Maroon baseball jackets and ringer Tees featuring a specific sports team's logo were particularly popular in the Philippines due to the widespread media coverage of the UAAP Games athletes. [139] [140] Business casual [ edit ] The business casual look of the 1990s and early 2000s remained common in many parts of America, with jeans, loafers , boat shoes and sneakers being seen as acceptable to wear in the workplace. [141] The decline in the formality of men's fashion that started in the 1960s continued until 2012, with men wearing informal clothing on a regular basis, even at work or while travelling, as an apparent extension of Beau Brummell 's older idea that gentlemen shouldn't try to outshine the ladies for attention. [142] This contrasted to Britain, Italy, Europe, and the urban Northeastern US, where more formal Mad Men -inspired business clothing such as slim-fitting grey suits had made a comeback in the workplace during the late 2000s and early 2010s . [143] Mid 2010s (2013-16) [ edit ] Workwear and luxury sportswear [ edit ] Urban fashion brand Supreme model, Sage Elsesser, 2015 In 2014, men's fashion was heavily influenced by the improving economy and fashion-conscious cities such as London , New York City , Paris , and Milan , as well as imitating elements of luxury fashion and sportswear . Bright colors and retro styled graphic prints [144] (especially 1960s-80s advertising logos, classic rock bands, and the loud Ed Hardy shirts) went out of style in favor of plain black, white, [145] beige , taupe , gray , marl , burgundy , and various shades of dark green . [146] Clothing items included tailored marl sweatpants, [147] jersey shirts , chunky hiking boots with thick soles, [148] bomber jackets , leather jackets, denim jackets, thick oversized anoraks , unstructured blazers, double-breasted sportcoats, [149] shorts riding above the knee (toward a 5"" inseam, down from 15""), [150] and jogger pants. [151] Sales in floral print clothing designs for men more than doubled amongst fashion retailers between 2013 and 2014. [152] From 2014 to 2016, workwear became a significant trend in Britain, Ireland and America. Besides the cardigan sweaters , knit caps , flat caps , dark denim jackets, waxed jackets , yellow fishermens macs, and flannel shirts previously popularised by indie kids , Grenson brogues , oxblood Red Wing work boots [153] and the grandfather collar shirt emerged as a semi-casual [154] fashion item in western cultures. [154] [155] [156] In China and Europe, retro feiyue martial arts sneakers in red, white and blue made a comeback. [157] Common accessories include Ray-Ban wayfarer sunglasses, [158] paisley scarfs , teashade glasses , [159] tortoise shell glasses, [160] snake skin [161] or plaited leather belts , [162] flat caps , newsboy caps , trilbys , [163] and pork pie hats . Formal business wear [ edit ] Male models walking in a Fashion Show In the UK, Italy, Australia [164] and US, many professional men wear grey mohair or houndstooth office suits , usually with two-button fastening, a single vent, and narrow lapels [165] inspired by the American TV show Mad Men , Hannibal , and Daniel Craig as James Bond . [166] [166] [167] [168] Businessmen in Asian countries like the Philippines generally followed the trend, but dispensed with the necktie in favor of a semi-formal, simple shirt better suited to the hot tropical climate. As part of the general 1980s revival, the waistcoat [169] made a comeback as part of the three piece suit in Europe and the US. [170] In the early 2010s these suits were mostly charcoal grey , [171] steel grey and silver, but by 2014 these were joined by air force blue , navy blue , [172] midnight blue , [173] and sky blue. In the UK, US and Germany, the suits of the mid 2010s often featured checks, [174] houndstooth , Glen plaid , bird's eye , Prince of Wales plaid cloth , [175] or windowpane tweed , [176] and the stripes on pinstripe suits became narrower [177] and more closely spaced. [178] Popular footwear of spring 2016 included round toed Oxford shoes , loafers, and Chelsea boots . [179] Thin ties remained the norm, but the simple notch lapels of 2010 were increasingly replaced by shawl collars and peak lapels on single breasted three piece suits. [180] By 2016, the black and silver digital wristwatches of the early 2010s had gone out of style [181] among professional men in favor of classic oversized analog wristwatches with round black, [182] gold or white faces [183] and traditional brown, tan or black leather straps. [184] [185] Continuing on from the 2000s, fur ushanka and Astrakhan caps were often worn at wintertime formal occasions in Russia, [186] Georgia, Kashmir , [187] and Pakistan [188] as both a symbol of national pride, and as a means of rejecting the excesses of Westernising globalization . [189] In Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, however, the wearing of traditional dress such as the Astrakhan cap , kurta and pajama began to decline among professionals in favor of a Western style suit and tie, as part of a wider backlash against Hamid Karzai 's regime. [190] African fashion [ edit ] African fashion, 2015. The mid 2010s witnessed the beginnings of Africa's own haute couture [191] due to increased restriction on secondhand mitumba clothing in Kenya and Uganda. [192] Contemporary clothing in Africa is often cut to unisex Western patterns but uses indigenous fabric associated with folk costume , such as a sportcoat made from striped kikoy fabric, a shirt made from kente cloth , or the silk Madiba shirts popularised in South Africa by Nelson Mandela . [193] At the same time, some aspects of traditional attire such as wooden jewelery or the Dashiki were worn by expatriate Africans in the West, African Americans , [194] and some liberal white Americans. [195] In South Africa and the Congo, Dandies known as sapeurs and swenkas began imitating the wardrobes of the previous colonialist regime, by importing expensive modern three piece designer suits and customising them with vintage accessories such as the fedora , spats , bowtie and cane. [196] [197] Youth fashion [ edit ] Hipsters and steampunks [ edit ] Main article: Hipster (contemporary subculture) By the early 2010s, British, American, and Filipino indie clothing had moved away from the bright colors and overt 1960s styling of the mid-2000s in favor of a more ""grown up"" intellectual look, with 1990s style earth-tones like grey, burgundy, brown, teal, and beige. [198] Tweed jackets, skinny chino trousers , dress boots , 2fer and layered shirts and tees, cardigan sweaters , nerdy horn-rimmed glasses , sweaters, thick wool socks, worker boots, leggings , [199] and beanies replaced the [200] winklepickers , velvet jackets, Aviator sunglasses , and skinny ties typically worn by indie rock bands, although vintage Western shirts , leather jackets , military dress uniforms , [201] homemade jewelery, and thrift store chic plaid shirts remained popular in Europe. [202] Drop crotch pants, designed by the Danish brand Hümor, became more and more popular in Europe amongst hipsters and hip hop fans, who replaced their skinny jeans and carpenter jeans with ""old school but modern"" style. [203] American Apparel made normcore a prominent aspect of hipster culture in the US from 2016 onwards. [204] [205] The look is based on modern business casual wear, everyday casual attire worn by older men, and the geek chic clothing worn by stereotypical nerds during the 1980s. [206] Popular accessories include horn rimmed glasses , high waisted pants especially pleated khaki chinos , dad hats, zip up polar fleeces , white or blue button down shirts, socks with sandals, turtlenecks , white tennis shoes , pocket protectors , leather shoes, plain sweaters in muted colors, and, for women, ""mom jeans"". [207] [208] In America, Australia and Japan, steampunk gained regional popularity among some young people aged 18–25. [209] [210] From 2011-15, members of this subculture often combined Neo-Victorian [211] clothing such as top hats , pocket watches , or (for girls) corsets, velvet or brocade dresses, brooches , and black, dark red or brown leather waistcoats, with bowties , hipster inspired beards and tweed clothing, jewelery made from brass gears, dark skinny jeans , worker boots, and flying goggles . [212] American and Asian Steampunks sometimes incorporate pirate shirts or petticoats borrowed from fantasy or Ren-Fair LARP , [213] and elements of Japanese street style such as Gothic Lolita inspired short skirts, [214] traditional silk kimonos , or parasols . [215] [216] Classic preppy [ edit ] Main article: Preppy During the early 2010s, American preppy guys moved away from the hip-hop influenced fashions of the early 2000s and begun to dress in a more classic 1950s Ivy League style [217] with sweaters , Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes , Aran sweaters , cardigans , Oxford shirts , Cricket pullovers , wingtips , stripy polo shirts , hats like the fedora , khaki or pastel colored Vineyard Vines , Nantucket Reds , white or bright pastel color socks worn with sneakers and Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes , colored jeans, white Nike Elite crew socks, baseball jackets , khaki shorts , and tapered chinos . [218] From 2012 onwards, seersucker blazers and pants made a comeback among young American men [219] due to a resurgence of interest in classic preppy clothing [220] and the 1920s fashion showcased in The Great Gatsby . Although pale blue and dark blue stripes remained the most popular choice, alternative colors included green, red and brown. The traditional two button blazer was updated with a slimmer cut and Edwardian inspired lapel piping, [221] and double breasted jackets became available during the mid 2010s. [222] Outside of the US, the Australian Olympic team received green and white candy stripe blazers for the 2016 Olympics [223] and Toms shoes rather than the traditional dark green jackets with gold trim. [224] Throughout the early and mid 2010s, Preppy girls wore flip flops , ballet flats , Keds worn in ads by Mischa Barton, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift, Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes , layered shirts and tees, capri pants , ankle length pants, colored jeans, opaque or footless tights , tweed cloth or plaid skirts , skater dresses, baby doll dresses, cotton shorts in pastel colors, Uggs , Hunter boots brand rain boots, leg warmers , white or pastel colored skinny jeans , railroad stripe blouses, knee socks , flat knee high riding boots , jeggings , capri or ankle length leggings worn with shorts, dresses and skirts, oversized sweaters, bike shorts with or without lace trim, 3/4 length sleeved shirts, tees and polos, Nike Tempo shorts, and sweatshirts bearing the name and crest of the school or college. In many schools with uniforms in colder weather students wear the school polo shirt underneath a school crew neck sweatshirt with the polos collar folded over the sweatshirt collar. Skater and sneakerhead fashion [ edit ] Main article: Sneakerhead Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer with their skater-influenced fashion, 2014. In America, Britain, Australia, Ethiopia [225] and the Philippines, many skaters wore designer streetwear such as joggers, hoodies, backwards baseball caps , and tracksuits in addition to the typical plaid shirts, ripped jeans and trucker hats . Common brands from 2012-15 included Diamond Supply Co., Hollister , The Hundreds, OBEY bar logo T-shirts and snapback hats , Vans , Converse All Stars , cannabis, camouflage or foliage print shirts, Levi's jeans, [226] Nike , LRG , [227] DGK , Adidas Skateboarding and Originals apparel and shoes, and T-shirts featuring the Santa Cruz Skateboards [228] screaming hand, eyeball, ""cartoon grotesque"" faces, [229] Black Madonna , [230] or Slasher cartoon character. [231] In America, Malaysia, [232] India, and China, [233] an offshoot of the skater subculture, known as "" sneakerheads "", dress similarly. Common mid-2010s sneakerhead apparel includes Nike Air Jordans , Air Yeezys , Nike SBs, DC Spartans , Supra Sky-Tops , Vans , designer sportswear , True Religion slim fit jeans , backwards baseball caps , red high-tops with fluorescent or reflective white stars, [234] Skullcandy headphones, leggings, slouched crew socks, and Keds (for girls), Aviator sunglasses , waffle plaid shirts, throwback basketball singlets, tracksuits, Nike Elite socks, cosmic print T-shirts, hoodies, and Nixon watches. [235] As of 2016, the most desirable [236] colors for sneakers and apparel were black, red [237] and white [238] due to their longstanding association with late 80s new wave music , the Michael Jordan era of basketball, [239] and old school hip-hop . [240] Scene kids and seapunks [ edit ] Main article: Scene kids From 2010-2013, the androgynous scene subculture (also known regionally as ""Shamate"" and ""Coloridos"") remained common in the West Coast United States, Europe, Australasia, parts of Asia, [241] and South America, especially in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza . [242] The style was influenced by hip-hop, emo, Japanese street style, and indie pop fashion, especially skinny jeans , trucker hats , Nike shoes , mismatched neon green , fluorescent yellow, bright blue or hot pink socks worn with sneakers, Vans , Levi's 501 jeans , [243] Dickies shorts, pocket watches , [244] flannel shirts, thin ties , Nike Elite crew socks guys and girls, Chucks , Keds , vintage tees sometimes featuring pop art designs, [245] plain tees with contrasting edging, and Vans . [246] Shirts and hoodies with messages such as ""cool story bro"" or the logos of music like Asking Alexandria , Blood on the Dance Floor and Bring Me the Horizon became popular among scene kids . By 2012, many scene kids had abandoned the cartoon print hoodies , skinny jeans and studded belts in favor of a more hardcore / skate punk look with short hair, A-shirts , plain hoodies, combat boots , Vans, skinny jeans, and stretched earlobe piercings . [247] Seapunk , a fusion of scene, electronic dance music and hipster culture, began as an online internet meme before becoming a niche street fashion in Germany, Brazil [248] and America. [249] This movement influenced several mainstream pop and hip-hop artists during the mid 2010s, most notably Azealia Banks , Frank Ocean , [250] and Rihanna . [251] Seapunks often combined brightly dyed androgynous hairstyles [252] with nautical themes such as mermaids or dolphins, plastic Ray Ban wayfarers , undercut hairstyles, [253] merman hair [254] and beards dyed blue, [255] shell jewelery, feathers, tartan overshirts associated with the surfer subculture, 1990s inspired yin-yang T-shirts, baseball caps , tie dye , transparent plastic jackets, [256] lots of green, light blue, turquoise, cyan or aquamarine clothing, smiley motifs, and red and blue 3-Dimensional images. [257] Hip-hop [ edit ] Main article: Hip hop fashion American rapper Tyga in 2013 Hip hop fans wear tactical pants , Nike , Air Jordans , Ralph Lauren Polo Boots, strapback caps, Obey and Diamond Supply Co. T-shirts and snapbacks, Hollister T-shirts, and goggle jackets . [258] [259] Retro 1980s and 1990s fashions like snapbacks, skinny acid-wash jeans, bucket hats , Retro mid-late 1990s strapback caps (Dad Hats), baseball jackets , nylon tracksuits , varsity jackets, Vans, Chuck Taylors , rain boots, retro Nikes, Shell tube socks, leather jackets, Levis, Adidas and Nike apparel, gold chains, Ray Ban sunglasses, Air Jordans , and oversized sweaters, and colors such as red, green, and yellow, made a comeback in the African American community due to the influence of drum and bass , rave music , and indie pop -inspired rappers. Independent brands have risen to popularity, as well as floral print items and tie-dye items. Button-down shirts are often worn fully buttoned. Timberlands are particularly popular in New York as a fashionable and durable shoe, their popularity originated in the 90s with rappers such as The Notorious B.I.G and Jay Z . [260] By the 2010s the boots' popularity is mainstream, and a staple in the fall and winter months. [261] Fashion designers such as Riccardo Tisci and Rick Owens begin to gain a new popularity within hip hop, popularized by rappers such as Kanye West and A$AP Rocky . Such designers inspire a ""darker"" aesthetic involving monochromatic colour schemes (usually black or grey), extra-long shirts usually sporting oversized neck openings and asymmetrical hems, skinny jeans that are worn with long inseams and an aggressive taper to cause bunching up or ""stacks"" near the ankle (a style heavily popularized and sported by Kanye) and high-top sneakers. Black boots, leather jackets, denim vests, bombers, monochrome sports jerseys, waxed jeans, black varsity jackets, tapered sweatpants, drop-crotch trousers, layering shorts over leggings and occasionally floral print are all popular trends within this style as well. Other notable rappers that sport this look include Kendrick Lamar , Danny Brown , and Pusha T . In the mid-2010s, dashikis became trendy in hip hop and afro-punk fashion, shown on celebrities like Beyoncé , Rihanna , Zendaya Coleman , and Chris Brown . [262] [263] Skater culture is also heavily prominent in hip hop fashion, largely attributed to alternative rapper Tyler the Creator . [264] Vans slip-ons, sk8-his, era, and ""old skool"" styles were popularized in the hip hop community by him and Kanye West . [265] Brands such as Supreme, Obey, Tyler the Creator's Odd Future clothing line, HUF, and the apparel of skater magazine Thrasher are popular in hip hop and street style. [266] [267] Cholo and chicano [ edit ] Main article: Mexican pointy boots In Mexico and the Southwestern US during the early 2010s, many members of the cholo , chicano and lowrider subcultures combine hip-hop fashion with Western shirts , traditional charro jackets, Stetson hats, skinny jeans , [268] and Cowboy boots [269] with elongated toes. These 3 ft long "" Mexican pointy boots ,"" associated with Tribal-guarachero music are an extreme version of the '60s-inspired Winklepickers popular in mid-2000s Britain. [270] By 2015, many young chicanos on the American West Coast had abandoned the garish Western inspired clubwear in favor of a more authentic 1950s inspired look. Pachuco style Zoot suits , fedoras and panama hats made a comeback, [271] together with more typical casual rockabilly fashions for everyday wear such as slim jeans, black leather jackets, bowling shirts , brightly colored blouses and flouncy skirts for girls, polka dot dresses with petticoats, and flowers worn in the hair. [272] K-pop and Jejemon [ edit ] K-Pop singer Psy Due to the spread of Hallyu Wave worldwide, millions of Asian and Asian-American youths have become addicted to K-Pop . These are the people who love listening to South Korean music and follow the style of artists and pop groups like Big Bang , Wonder Girls , Kim Soo Hyun , or Gangnam Style singer Psy . [273] Since the Korean girl and boy bands wore extravagant clothing, some of the hardcore fans in China, Korea, America and the Philippines tried to copy their idols and started wearing K-Pop style hairstyles and clothing. [274] These included skull, floral or honeycomb prints, monochromatic shirts, silk jackets featuring stylized Asian art prints or pop art , [275] leather skirts, black and neon printed leggings, retro joggers, short shorts, black and gold jewelery, brightly colored tuxedo jackets, tracksuits, basketball shirts, leather caps, and sequined or glitter jackets. [276] [277] During the early part of the 2010s, a new youth subculture called Jejemon arose in the Philippines, sparking a brief moral panic among some older conservatives and other youths. [278] The Philippine Daily Inquirer describes Jejemons as a ""new breed of hipster who have developed not only their own language and written text but also their own subculture and fashion. [279] These predominantly working class youths are associated with wearing trucker hats and use their own language through texting and via social media such as Facebook . [280] They are often criticized by others for not using the words properly; even the Department of Education discouraged use of the Jejemon language. Apart from the language, the Jejemons were also criticized for their fashion and manners. From early 2013 onwards, with the rise of smartphones which began to overtake feature phones in terms of sales in the country, the phenomenon seems to have made a gradual decline in mainstream popularity. 2010s beauty trends [ edit ] Hairstyles [ edit ] Women [ edit ] Actress Jennifer Lawrence with a wavy hairstyle Indian woman with straightened hair wearing a kurta as a dress, 2014. Women's hairstyles in the early 2010s have been fairly individualistic, although most British, Australian, Russian, Korean, and continental European women kept the simplistic, straight, long and natural colored hairstyles of the mid 2000s. Bangs were often centrally parted, blunt cut , side swept or left straight down above the eyes, [281] and many women also used hair extensions to make their hair look much longer and fuller. [282] In America [283] and Israel, [284] volumized curly hair, [285] perms and crimped hair were briefly fashionable from 2010–12, [286] especially in New York City . [287] [288] By the mid 2010s, straight and wavy hairstyles were dominant globally, [289] [290] especially the blonde dyed beach waves . [291] Traditional and intricate styles such as a bun , chignon , French twist , updo , crown braid , [292] or French braid , inspired by the Hunger Games ' Katniss Everdeen , were also popular among young women and girls from 2012-16. [293] [294] By 2013 it had become increasingly fashionable for European, Asian [295] and American women to cut their hair into shorter styles, [296] such as the pixie cut , [297] [298] crop , [299] bob cut [300] [301] or the undercut . [302] [303] [304] Solid colored hair was generally considered the most fashionable in the early years of the decade, but from 2012-14 it became increasingly common for Western women to dye their hair in an ombré style, usually long and preferably parted in the middle, as the side part became associated with the previous decade aesthetics. From 2012-16, many African-American , Black Canadian, [305] and Afro-Caribbean British women favored natural, Afro-textured hair [306] and dreadlocks , [307] opting for natural products to style their hair. During the mid 2010s, some curly haired American women also choose to wear weaves and wigs in imitation of celebrities like Lady Gaga or Rihanna , in order to avoid the damage of relaxers previously popular in the early 2000s. [308] Cornrows , also known as ""boxer braids"" due to their use by female MMA fighters and Hilary Swank 's character in Million Dollar Baby , became popular among white American women from 2016 onwards, despite allegations of cultural appropriation [309] and imitation of the complex braided hair traditionally worn by black women such as the singer Beyoncé . [310] [311] [312] Men [ edit ] Example of the Undercut and designer stubble worn by footballer David Beckham , 2012 Orlando Bloom with Samurai bun , 2014 In the early 2010s, men's 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s haircuts have undergone a revival, with many British professionals aged 18–30 wearing businessman's haircuts with side partings, [313] quiffs [314] or slicked back hair . [315] [316] The undercut has been a particularly ubiquitous trend since the early part of the decade, seeing popularity across different social groups in both Western and Asian cultures. [317] [318] These gradually replaced [319] the longer surfer hair and Harry Styles haircuts [320] popular among teenagers and young men since the mid 2000s. [321] [322] In America and the Middle East, the military haircut and buzzcut are relatively popular among balding men, or the side parted hair with some volume on the top. For African-American men, mohawk variants of the Afro , The 360 Waves , jheri curl and The Taper are popular in the 2010s, as are shaved patterns or ""steps"" into variants of the buzzcut. The High Top Fade , often with a bleached blonde streak inspired by Wiz Khalifa , came back into style among African American youth on the West Coast. From 2014 onwards, some teens and young men wore their hair in a type of topknot or ""man bun"" [323] reminiscent of the samurai hairstyles [324] in wuxia movies. This trend was popularised by British and American celebrities including actor Orlando Bloom , Jared Leto , TOWIE 's Joey Essex , [325] and pop singers Harry Styles [326] and Zayn Malik . Youth [ edit ] For young girls, tween and teen girls, and college girls the bangs and thin headband combination has remained popular. Braids, side ponytails, and a single chunky side braid are popular styles with longer hair. Side parting hair is popular, and ponytails are often worn when exercising or playing sports. The chin length bob cut , long hair with choppy side bangs, and straight middle parted longer hair are also popular styles in the US, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. [ citation needed ] In the UK, Middle East, [327] and Australia during the early 2010s, a type of short mullet haircut with buzzed sides and bleached blond streaks became popular among male chavs , teenage Irish travellers , and urban youths of Iranian [328] and Lebanese descent [329] inspired by The Combination crime film. [330] By 2012, a long undercut or mohawk -like haircut, in which only one side of the head is buzzed, [331] became popular among circles of ravers , hipster girls, metalcore , and dubstep fans in the US, inspired by Skrillex [332] and various female pop stars such as Ellie Goulding , [333] Tess Aquarium, Miley Cyrus , [334] or Rihanna . [335] The emo style fringes also went out of fashion around the same time. [336] [337] By 2015 and 2016, the balayage"" -' a softer version off the ombré - gained popularity, as well as having a blunt haircut intead of layered hair. The lob (long bob cut ) was considered a fresh alternative to the long hair sported by most teen girls and young women in Europe. For boys, teen guys and college guys in The United States, Canada, Australasia, the UK and Korea, [338] the layered short hair style , the buzzed short hairstyle which is blended from the sides to the top , [339] and the Blowout (hairstyle) became popular during the mid 2010s due to continued interest in 1980s and 1990s fashion . Additionally the side swept bangs , the quiff , and the layered longer hair [340] of the late 2000s remain fashionable among American preppy guys. Makeup and cosmetics [ edit ] In Britain, the smoky eye look of the late 2000s carried on as a trend in many parts of the country. In other areas, these went out of fashion as women sought to imitate the fake tan and thick ""Scouse brow"" popularized by Kate Middleton and the cast of The Only Way is Essex and Desperate Scousewives . [341] In the Western, contouring (using different shades of makeup to create highlighted angles, creating an illusion of higher cheekbones, slim nose and a sharper jawline) was the technique taking the makeup world by storm. [342] As contouring was being overly exploited, by 2015 and 2016 the new skin trend on the spotlight is strobing, which consisted of using glowy highlighters to accentuate the high points of the face. Although dewy natural skin replaced the matte finish of previous years, matte lips remained the most popular throughout the 2010s. [343] [344] The early decade's ""erased-mouth"" and pale pink lipsticks were replaced by matte red by 2012-13 and burgundy or other dark shades in 2014. By 2015-16, mauve and brown shades make a comeback from the 1990s, promoted by Kylie Jenner. The full eyebrow is the biggest obsession and makeup brands start offering every kind of product to achieve the effect of Cara Delevingne's natural brows. Sun-kissed skin is moderately desired in the summer, but paleness and any other natural skin tone is not frowned upon in winter, unlike the beggining of the previous decade when tans and fake tans were almost mandatory. The alternative youth of the mid 2010s praised urban beauty and the pale aesthetic in social media, promoting the health goth look with pale skin and sporty looks. Body modifications [ edit ] A man with sleeve tattoos, beard and flannel shirt, mid 2010s. Continuing on from the 1990s and 2000s, body modifications remained popular among many teenagers [345] and blue collar men and women in Britain, [346] Japan, [347] Israel, [348] Singapore, [349] New Zealand and Australia. [141] [350] Old school tattoos were popularised by female celebrities like Kat Von Dee [351] imitating the pinup girls of the 1950s, [352] and by men like footballer David Beckham , [353] pop star Harry Styles [354] or Justin Bieber aspiring for the ""tough guy"" look. [355] The earrings and tongue piercings [356] that had gained mainstream acceptance in the late 2000s were joined by more extreme modifications such as stretched piercings , blackout tattoos, [349] flesh tunnels , lip piercings , and nose piercings , particularly the nose septum piercing that went from indie to mainstream between 2013 and 2016. [357] Facial hair [ edit ] In many western countries, the US, and Eastern Europe, [358] the growing of a full beard became a popular trend amongst young males in the early-to-mid 2010s, with some suggesting this was due to the influence of the hipster subculture, the lumbersexual ideal, and the Movember campaign. [359] [360] An increase in facial hair transplants was reported in the United Kingdom in the first three years of the decade, [361] and the trend approached what researchers predicted would be a 'peak' level of desirability.

31," Red-Soled Fashionista: What is Fashion? “Fashion is so often presented in the culture as a thing of froth, which, of course, it partly is; but the bubbles are blown with care and a sense of values.” - Anna Wintour October 8, 2016 What is Fashion? I am currently reading a book, titled 'Women in Clothes', filled with short stories, interviews, and blurbs exploring the relationship between women and their clothing. This book aims to fill a perceived gap left by fashion magazines: ""A problem I've always had with fashion magazines is that women are encouraged to copy other women ... The most compelling women are the ones who are distinctive, who are most like themselves and least like other women ... It's almost as if fashion magazines don't understand what a woman wants. I think she wants to be unique among other women, a creature unlike any other."" -- Sheila Heti in 'Women in Clothes' Instead of instructing women on what to wear, how to wear it, and when to wear it, this book recognizes that style is very personal. Style is not about following the supposed all-knowing commands of the fashion elite, but the unique ways in which one makes a particular combination of clothing their own. Style is more about how one feels and acts than is it about what one wears. As a result, style is very difficult to transfer or copy because its essence is drawn from within. One of my favourite concepts from the book is that the most stylish women are not always the most well-dressed. Rather, a woman is stylish because she has an acute awareness of the clothing she has on. It might be kooky and strange - wearing a sweater inside out to show the seams, or tying the sleeves of a jacket diagonally across the torso instead of around the waist - but that type of individuality demonstrates a keen consciousness about the clothing's presence on the body. Upon telling my dear friend about this book, he came back with the idea fashion is not bound by anything other than the rules we set for ourselves. Style is an identity. It may be a mixture of cultural influences and personal preference, but its inherent appeal is ultimately idiosyncratic. And that, I think, is exactly what this book is trying to say. As I spoke more with my friend, he asked a question I couldn't believe I had not answered on this blog yet: What is fashion? I have never formally articulated this, but fashion is not simply about the glitz and glamour, the runway shows and photoshoots, the gorgeous models and expensive clothes... These are certainly things encompassed within the realm of the industry, but getting to the deeper meaning of fashion requires thinking more intangibly. To me, fashion is two things: self-expression and fantasy . Self-expression: Fashion is more than just the clothing we put on our bodies. It is a way of communicating who we are to the world. In aggregate, fashion can instigate movements and embody cultural zeitgeist. As individuals, fashion is a mechanism to express our inner selves. No matter how little someone claims to care about fashion, everyone sends a message with what they choose to wear. Someone who puts minimal thought into an outfit sends just as bountiful a message as someone who invests significant effort. And as much as the industry makes it seem like there is right and wrong in dressing, truly good fashion comes from having the confidence to shatter the rules. Fantasy: An interesting thing about fashion is, in addition to being a form of self-expression, it's also a way for us to become someone we're not. Fashion gives us the opportunity to explore other identities - to almost play pretend. I might walk with a heavier step and more attitude in an all-black outfit with edgy ankle boots, and glide with poise and grace in an elegant knee-length dress with ballet flats. Fashion provides me with the tools to briefly inhabit different personas and change the way I present myself. As I've mentioned before, fashion is a form of art to me. The industry is rich with creativity because it's a platform to live out our wildest dreams and fantasies - a world where we can wear things which might be impractical or ""unwearable"", but which are oh so very beautiful and stunning. With regards to whether there is a distinction between 'style' and 'fashion', it depends on who you ask. ""Fashion fades, style is eternal,"" Yves Saint Laurent once said. But I think if you really get to the heart of things, both are heavily rooted in confidence and self-expression. Fashion feeds into style, and style feeds into fashion. With no beginning nor end, the swirling duo whip up a glimmering cloud of beauty, fantasy and individuality.

A recent study by a clothing company found that close to 90% of women in America reported that their self-esteem and overall confidence is determined on their appearance. The majority of women perceive flaws in their body, despite their shape and size. The study found that 63% of women highlighted their stomachs as their least favourite part of their body. 45% reported that they didn’t like their thighs, 34% their hips and 33% their bottoms. These body issues tend to be present in women who wear UK size 12 and above. 65% of the women involved in the study explained that their weight control was unsuccessful. Obviously, the most effective solutions for looking and feeling better as well as boosting body confidence is a good diet and exercise regime, however many women have discovered shape wear, which are usually worn as underwear. These garments suck and hold you in where you feel less confident. For example, you can buy high rise underwear which hold and smooth your stomach to make you appear slimmer. Shape wear brands often offer an exceptional collection of ready-to-wear clothing with shape wear panels built in already. These panels slim down the waist-line, decrease the hips and lift the rear. Great-fitting trousers, skirts, dresses and a wide range of swimwear are available. These collections are great for every size and shape. Although shaping underwear is possibly the most effective way of creating a slimmer body shape, we can offer these 5 tips which guarantee a slimmer image: If you have a fuller bust and feel this may make you appear larger than you actually are, opt for a higher neckline for support. This will also create an optical illusion and your bust will appear smaller. Choose clothing that gathers at the waist to exaggerate your curves. To create a slimmer appearance, choose clothing with vertical striped patterns and princess seam detailing. Horizontal stripes will do the opposite. Bootcut jeans and skirts that flare at the bottom will create the illusion of smaller hips, thighs and rear, so if you’re a pear shape this is a great style for you. Tunic tops also conceal hips and the bottom. A great way to soften your silhouette and obliterate imperfections is to choose clothing with super controls materials like Lycra and power-mesh panels.

Will it work for fashion? Rent the Runway offers customers access to an ""unlimited"" closet | Source: Rent the Runway 3,892 Shares Comment By Helena Pike May 8, 2016 12:23 3,892 Shares Comment By Helena Pike May 8, 2016 12:23 LONDON, United Kingdom — For a long time, we’ve had to buy the items we want to use, regardless of how much or little we use them. For items we need access to all the time — like fridges — or items we feel it would be strange to share — like toothbrushes — ownership makes sense. But for items we only use once in a while, ownership is not cost-effective, and yet, it is often the only way to ensure on-demand access. Today, technology has created platforms for new online marketplaces and provided better channels of communication to connect users and owners, which have made sharing resources at scale cheaper and easier than ever. Customers can hire a car for an hour with Getaround, stay in a local’s spare room with Airbnb, or hitch a ride in someone else’s vehicle with Uber. The growth of the sharing economy has been rapid. Pricewaterhouse Coopers predicts that by 2025, the five key sectors of the sharing economy — staffing, finance, car sharing, travel and music and video streaming — could generate $335 billion in annual revenue, up from about $15 billion today. As of 2015, global investments in sharing start-ups totalled more than $12 billion — more than double the investments in social media start-ups — according to Deloitte. For owners, the sharing economy transforms possessions into revenue streams, by enabling items to be useful all of the time: someone who only uses their car to drive to and from work each day can rent the vehicle to other drivers in the interim. For customers, the sharing economy provides convenience, value (it’s cheaper to pay to use something for a short time rather than buy it outright) and a greater choice of products and services. It also offers access without ownership — something that has resonated with millennial consumers, who came of age in the recession and are economically-minded, and who increasingly value experiences over material goods. But can the sharing economy work in fashion? Clothing and accessories often have high value but low usage — characteristics of other items that have proved popular in sharing consumption models, explains Arun Sundararajan, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business. “It’s quite common to have clothing that costs three figures or four figures,” he says, many of which are bought and worn only occasionally. In the US alone, over $8 billion worth of clothing sits in closets, unworn, according to a report by online thrift store ThredUp. As a result, dozens of fashion companies have entered the sharing economy fray in the last few years, adopting a number of different business models to tap the opportunity. Fashion Rental Services Rental models allow customers to borrow items for a set time period, typically at the cost of 10 to 20 percent of an item’s retail value. Perhaps the best known of these is US-based Rent the Runway, which launched in 2009 and today has over 5.5 million members. However, the swath of start-ups in the field includes Girl Meets Dress in the UK, Chic By Choice in Europe and Glam Corner in Australia, as well as more niche ventures, such as Gwynnie Bee (plus-size fashion rental) and Borrow For Your Bump (maternitywear rental). “The reason someone buys a suit, or shoes, or a gown, is to have easy, inexpensive access to the stream of services that item provides. If it’s possible to rent, one can enjoy that stream of services for a brief period,” explains Michael Munger, professor at Duke University. By loaning clothing on a pay-per-use basis, rental companies also lower the cost of items, giving customers access to aspirational brands they couldn’t usually afford, says Greg Portell, a partner in retail and media at A.T. Kearney. “You wouldn’t necessarily spend $700 on a one-time use or even two-time use item, but you may spend $100 [to rent] it for a one-time use.” With more spending power and choice, but less commitment, consumers can use rental sites to constantly update their wardrobes, enabling them to keep up with fashion’s fast-turning trend cycles. “You’re able to experience a trend without feeling horrible that you’ve paid all this money for something you can wear once or twice,” says Trisha Gregory, co-founder and chief executive officer of Armarium, an app-based luxury fashion rental service that launched in April. This proposition is particularly attractive to millennial and Generation Z consumers, many of whom shop at affordable, fast fashion retailers to regularly update their “look,” says Robin Lewis, chief executive officer of the Robin Report, a retail strategy publication. “They may know the quality isn’t the finest, but they’ll wear [an item] for the weekend and it won’t bother them — it’s disposable,” he explains. “You used to be able to wear one outfit to work and then repeat it on the weekend with a group of friends. Now, because you’ve already photographed yourself and put the photo up on Instagram, you need more variety,” adds Jennifer Hyman , co-founder and chief executive officer of Rent the Runway. But unlike Airbnb and Getaround, which connect users with a marketplace of third-party controlled goods, meaning consumers can monetise their own unused assets, a fashion rental company must take on the role of owner — purchasing and holding all the stock they rent out. Fashion rental services also face greater logistical barriers. “Uber and Airbnb are software programmes…all [they] have to do is connect folks who could exchange on their own,” says Michael Munger. By contrast, fashion deals in products that are more difficult to transport between users, and require maintenance between uses — such as dry cleaning and repairs — which create operational challenges and costs for businesses. Rent the Runway has invested heavily in logistics, to ensure products that are returned to the company in the morning can be ready to ship to a new customer that evening. It is currently the US’s biggest dry cleaner, operating a 160,000 square foot fulfilment centre that dry cleans 2,000 dresses every hour. The majority of returned items are cleaned and sent back out for a delivery within a day. Peer-to-Peer Platforms Peer-to-peer rental services connect consumers and let them borrow from each other. “That value proposition is obvious to people,” says Sundararajan. “‘I’ve got all this stuff in my closet, it would be great to rent it out.’” But this model has specific challenges: “Every peer-to-peer marketplace has the challenge of getting enough people in so that they actually have sufficient inventory,” Sundararajan continues. In fashion, the wide range of product styles and sizes make this difficult to achieve. Rent the Runway buys each product in a range of sizes, and sends users two sizes in case the one they order doesn’t fit. But for peer-to-peer rental services, this problem is harder to fix. “It’s hard to rent a dress or a gown from someone who only owns one size,” says Munger, “There is not enough density to allow peer-to-peer connections.” Peer-to-peer businesses also need to figure out how to get fashion items from the owner to the user, and ensure items are in good condition. Some companies handle these logistics themselves. In the US, peer-to-peer rental service StyleLend requires owners to send in items they want to rent out. The company stores them in its New York offices, and handles delivery and dry-cleaning, much like a traditional rental company. Meanwhile, ?when it first launched, users of UK-based Rentez-Vous were responsible for cleaning their own items, and had to arrange to have each item delivered, or meet their customer and hand over the item in person. While this cut costs for the business, it made usages less smooth for customers, and the company has recently introduced an integrated dry cleaning service and last minute delivery option to make transactions easier for both owners and renters. Industry Impact So far, the sharing economy has been slower to take off in retail, compared to sectors such as transportation or hospitality. According to a 2015 report by PwC, just 2 percent of the US population have engaged in a sharing transaction in the retail sector, compared to 6 percent for hospitality and 8 percent for transport. But some believe that, if the fashion sharing economy flourishes, its effect on traditional retailers could be profound. Rent the Runway’s Hyman predicts that fast fashion businesses, in particular, could be affected, as customers use rental services to borrow high quality on-trend seasonal pieces, rather than buy cheaper versions on the high street. Customers will continue to buy everyday staples — such as a good pair of jeans or a classic leather jacket — but turn to rentals for occasion-wear and statement pieces with a limited wardrobe lifespan, she says: “Consumers will become smarter about what they want to own forever and what they don’t want to own forever.” “Our service will supplement the capsule wardrobe,” agrees Armarium’s Gregory. “They’ll use us to stand out from the crowd at a cocktail party or make a good impression on a job interview or a date.” “[Buying] is not about disposable things, it’s about things that can last and that you can rent if you’re not using, and will keep their value for a long time,” adds Neal Gorenflo, co-founder of Shareable, a news and connection site for sharing businesses. But although sharing could have a negative impact on retail sales, “it would actually increase economic activity overall,” argues Sundararajan. “Through renting and transporting and all of that, the money you spend on clothes will go up, even as the number of clothes you buy goes down.” Limits on Sharing Fashion “Logistics seems to be the key barrier to this really taking off,” says Sundararajan. Because of style and fit variation, a fashion marketplace needs to offer consumers a wider range of products than other sharing economy sectors, like cars or accommodation. Inventory turnover is also much higher in fashion, to keep up with trends. In the crowded sharing economy space, where many companies don’t have such high overheads, this can make fashion companies less appealing to venture capitalists. Convincing people to share clothes with other people requires a much bigger behavioural shift than convincing them to share vehicles or accommodation — both of which have been available to rent for years. “Part of the attraction [of fashion] is wearing a creation for the first time… the sense that the item is new,” explains Munger, who says some customers may also feel uncomfortable wearing something worn by a stranger. Lewis agrees: “People are still interested in buying apparel. I can’t imagine that they’re just going to rent and share forever and forget about that.” Editor's Note: This article was revised on April 10th, 2016. A previous version of this article misstated that users of Rentez-Vous were responsible for cleaning their own items, and must arrange to have each item delivered, or meet their customer and hand over the item in person. This is incorrect. The company has also recently introduced an integrated dry cleaning service and last minute delivery option. A previous version of this article also misstated that Rent the Runway dry cleaned 1,500 dresses every hour. This is incorrect. It is 2,000.

45," Fashion accessory - Wikipedia Fashion accessory From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Burberry -brand handbag A fashion accessory is an item used to contribute, in a secondary manner, to the wearer's outfit , often used to complete an outfit and chosen to specifically complement the wearer's look. [1] The term came into use in the 19th century. Contents 1 Types 2 History 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Types [ edit ] Fashion accessories can be loosely categorized into two general areas: those that are carried and those that are worn. Traditional carried accessories include purses and handbags , eyewear , hand fans , parasols and umbrellas , wallets , canes , and ceremonial swords . Accessories that are worn may include jackets , boots and shoes , cravats , ties , hats , bonnets , belts and suspenders , gloves , muffs , jewelry , watches , sashes , shawls , scarves , lanyards , socks , and stockings . [1] History [ edit ] In Victorian fashion accessories such as fans, parasols and gloves held significance for how women experienced gender, race and class. In this era, there was a trend for women to adopt, or aspire to, a more leisurely lifestyle. Consequently, gloves were often used by women to cover their hands and mask any signs of labor. [2] Also, in the early 16th century in Italy hat badges were worn by civilian men of a higher social status as decorative item, in imitation of the cap badges worn by the invading military. Hat badges were often worn in conjunction with a decorative sword and hilt. Hat badges were fashioned after plaquettes and often depicted a scene with personal relevance to the wearer.

Add the first question. User Reviews The depth of fashion 7 November 2008 | by tambe (India) – See all my reviews Fashion was a really nice movie, and mostly it was it was showing the life of models. It even shows the models dark side, not only smoking, drinking etc. Priyanka Chopra did a very good acting as Meghna Mathur. But I felt that if she could have given a bit more expressions it would have been a better film. Kangana Raunat did a satisfying role as Shonali Gujral. She was into her character. Specially then when she had to act drunken etc. I guess she was the one who acted the best in this movie. But I still think the movie could be made shorter. She really showed how ambitious she was. Priyanka really showed how nicely she could act and do cat walk. I think Madhur Bhandarkar has made a really successful and real life based movie. His movie has a depth and shows the real life of models. You all should go and see this incredible movie. 10 of 16 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?

Love this sweater. Would like the colors in the scarf but not plaid -- maybe a softer floral or just blocked. Probably wouldn't wear fringed boots, but boot height is nice. The bag is too big for me. Would overwehelm me. This outfit looks great, and another awesome autumn [and winter] look is plaid. Start off with colours like plum purple and beige in autumn, and then at winter switch to rich reds and greens, a more traditional design. Purse is hideous and I don't like the shoes, but the rest is kind of cute. Why is it so hard to find fall/winter pants that aren't skinny legs? I hate skinny legs! Want your own personal stylist?
