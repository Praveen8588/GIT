Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee Kendrapara, Nov. 18: The Narendra Modi government's demonetisation move has left the government-run central co-operative banks and the farmers' co-operative societies, the banking lifeline in rural Odisha attached to them, gasping for breath in larger part of the state, especially in the agriculturally rich coastal belt. While these banks are witnessing long queues of people eager to withdraw cash, money deposits have dried up leading to cash crunch. These banks with a large number of affiliated primary agriculture societies, popularly referred to as mini-banks, account for Rs 125 crore deposits in this coastal district alone. But, they have fallen out of favour following a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directive, apparently prompted by allegations of politicians using them to launder their black money, issued on November 14 that debars them from taking cash deposits in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and engaging in exchange activities like other banks. With withdrawals getting the better of deposits, the cash reserve in these beleaguered financial institutions has now plunged to a little over Rs 100 crore. The plight of these banks has forced chief minister Naveen Patnaik to write to the Centre to allow them to transact normal business like others as a large number of depositors in the rural areas, especially farmers, depend on them. ""The mini-bank at my village is treating me as if I have stashed ill-gotten wealth in the form of scrapped notes. They refused to accept four scrapped 500 rupee notes. I had to rush to a nationalised bank at Pattamundai, about 12km from here, to exchange the notes. As a mark of protest, I have withdrawn my deposits from bank at my village,"" said Choudkulat villager Saroj Kanta Das, 52. Sachikant Behera from Kora village voiced similar fears. ""Today, Modi ji has barred our village co-operative society from exchanging the scrapped notes. Tomorrow, the Centre may scrap these institutions altogether. Since safety of my money is a priority, I have withdrawn a large part of my savings in the mini-bank."" Bank officials are equally worried. ""We are bearing the brunt of the demonetisation. Yesterday, only three account holders turned up to deposit money, while many withdrew. We also fell short of cash,"" Bharatpur Village Co-operative Society bank executive Subodh Kumar Lenka told The Telegraph . Apart from providing loan at 1 per cent annual interest to the farmers, the societies had emerged as ""trusted"" bankers receiving cash and paying back to depositors when they needed money. ""But, the government's so-called masterstroke to eliminate black money has dealt us a telling blow with people developing a trust deficit,"" said Chitta Ranjan Sahu, a co-operative society member at Bedari village. Kendrapara Central Co-operative Bank's branch manager Rabindra Kumar Biswal admitted: ""The demonetisation has adversely affected operations of the central co-operative banks and the village co-operative societies. We have nine central co-operative banks and 109 primary agriculture societies in the district. Account holders are withdrawing money. Rate of deposits has dipped drastically. If things go on this way, our deposit reserves may get severely eroded. As we are not accepting the demonetised currency, in accordance to the Union government's directives, people are feeling let down."" ""We provide subsidised crop loans and farm inputs to farmers twice a year before the beginning of rabi and kharif seasons. The rabi crop loan disbursal process, which commenced towards the October end, has been halted abruptly because of the cash crunch,"" said Choudkulat Primary Agriculture Society's branch executive Hemant Patra. Several officials of co-operative banks feel that the cash crunch would inevitably lead to non-availability of loans to farmers and is bound to hit the rabi (winter) cultivation. Kendrapara district collector Debendra Prasad Das, however, said withdrawal from these banks appeared to be a temporary phenomenon. ""People might be withdrawing money for their daily needs,"" he said. Things are no better in Ganjam district with the Berhampur Co-operative Central Bank facing the prospects of customers developing a trust deficit. ""We are losing the confidence of people after the demonetisation,"" said the bank's secretary Chittaranjan Panigrahi, adding that the bank had stopped accepting scrapped notes from November 15 following an RBI directive. With co-operative banks not accepting scrapped notes, farmers have to travel to faraway places to get their old notes exchanged, which is causing a loss of mandays. The bank covers 11 out of the 22 blocks of Ganjam district and all the seven blocks of the neighbouring Gajapati district with more than 1.60 lakh customers, including 70,000 farmers. ""Most of our customers don't have accounts in other banks. They are approaching us to deposit their demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, but we can't,"" said Panigrahi. The two ATMs of the bank in Berhampur and at Paralakhemundi are closed due to the cash crunch. Panigrahi said the RBI's decision would be a setback also for disbursement of crop loans during the current rabi season. Things, however, were slightly better at the Balasore Bhadrak Central Co-operative Bank that collected deposits worth around Rs 60 crore till November 14. The bank's deputy general manager Jaldhara Panda said: ""All our branches have note detecting machines. Fifty per cent of co-operative societies also have those. So, there is no justification in not accepting deposit."" However, the RBI directive preventing the bank from exchanging scrapped currency has triggered resentment. The bank's assistant manager Prasant Das said: ""There was a token demonstration today against the RBI directive. On November 23, there would be a demonstration before the RBI Bhubaneswar by all employees of banks across Odisha and finally on November 25 in Delhi.""

Since the very beginning, when the Regional Rural Banks in India (RRBs) were established in October 2, 1975, these banks played a pivotal role in the economic development of the rural India. The main goal of establishing regional rural banks in India was to provide credit to the rural people who are not economically strong enough, especially the small and marginal farmers, artisans, agricultural labours, and even small entrepreneurs. The Conception and the Brief history The history of regional rural banks in India dates back to the year 1975. It's the Narsimham committee that conceptualized the foundation of regional rural banks in India. The committee felt the need of 'regionally oriented rural banks' that would address the problems and requirements of the rural people with local feel, yet with the same level of professionalism of commercial banks. Five regional rural banks were set up on October 2 with a total authorized capital of ` 1 crore, which later augmented to ` 5 crore. There were five commercial banks, viz. Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Syndicate Bank, United Bank of India and United Commercial Bank, which sponsored the regional rural banks. The equities of rural banks were divided in a proportion of 50:35:15 among the Central Government, the Sponsor bank and the concerned State Government. The following years have not been so easy for the regional rural banks in India, as there were major concern of financial viability. A number of committees were formed to find out solution. Studies were conducted to find out the factors that influence RRBs performance. The roles played by the sponsor banks were also analyzed. List of Regional Rural Banks in India There are a number of regional rural banks in India. Following are the state-wise list of Indian regional rural banks.

The bank completes a year of operations next week and has a presence in 50,000 villages through its 701 branches. “Currently, 33 per cent of our branches are in rural areas, some of which were un-banked ones,” he said in an interview. Poor Internet connectivity in the rural and semi -urban branches was one of the biggest hurdles in extending banking services since August 23, 2015, when the bank started operations. Skill development for the employees was also another challenge. Bandhan is not only the first micro-financing institution to get a universal banking licence from the Reserve Bank of India, but it is also the first bank to be headquartered in Kolkata, since Independence. Micro-credit customers Although the bank started with the advantage of its micro-credit customers migrating to the bank, it has acquired over 20 lakh additional customers with its total base now standing at over 89 lakhs. Bandhan’s deposit base now stands at around Rs.16,000 crore with a loan disbursal of Rs.16,500 crore. Aside from micro-credit, the bank’s loan portfolio is spread over the medium, small and micro-enterprises, retail loans and start-ups according to Mr. Ghosh. The bank has so far not extended support to any large corporations. It recently opened an NRI branch at the upscale Park Street area in Kolkata. Mr. Ghosh expects business at this branch to pick up from the second half of this fiscal, when NRIs come to the city. With a recovery rate of 99 per cent and a capital adequacy of 29 per cent, Bandhan’s journey so far has been good, according to its founder “There is money in the rural areas, which needs to be channelised,” he said. BBL closed 2015-16 with a Rs 275.3 crore profit.

They will find a veritable treasure trove. Written by Aditya Puri | Updated: May 3, 2016 8:31 pm Rural bank lending has historically been driven by regulation through the mandated priority sector lending commitments rather than by a genuine search for business. (Illustration by CR Sasikumar) Rural households constitute 55-60 per cent of India’s population. The key to India’s prosperity thus lies in increasing the affluence of this so-called Bharat. Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have long recognised the potential of this market and the penetration rates of some of their products like hair oil, shampoos and beverages, just to take a few examples, is close to saturation. Yet, the financial sector in this vast rural economy is still dominated by the unorganised segment. Rural bank lending has historically been driven by regulation through the mandated priority sector lending commitments rather than by a genuine search for business. It’s still a very underpenetrated market. Rural markets are highly dispersed and fragmented across villages and semi-urban pockets. The lack of infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, has been a problem. The need to create small-ticket offerings to cater to this market has meant that traditional business models have proved unviable. However, this has been changing rapidly and some banks have taken the lead in adjusting their strategy to exploit this untapped goldmine. Technology, particularly the growing wave of digitisation and the mobile phone revolution, has lent a helping hand as has been the government’s push to energise these markets. Thus, from a banker’s perspective, Bharat is on a roll — rural financial markets are in the process of taking a quantum leap in the new century. Based on the tremendous market potential, it’s vital that banks look at these deeper semi-urban and rural geographies to expand their branch network. For a first mover, this would create a long-term advantage for the incumbent, even with subsequent entry by others. A good rural strategy is to provide a complete range of appropriate products for rural customers and replace the moneylender who has traditionally charged crippling rates for the rural poor, perpetuating a vicious cycle of debt. The key to success in these markets is to develop appropriate products for this segment of customers, instead of offering the same products that work in urban markets. Appropriate products and fair lending rates would automatically eliminate the moneylender, as we have seen in our experience. But to achieve this, the entire paradigm of product design, sales and collection would have to be turned on its head. A couple of examples of appropriate products would help underscore the point. For wheat farmers, the time taken between delivering the produce to the agent at the time of grain procurement and his final payment through a cheque or draft typically took 15 to 20 days. With digitisation, this process can be crunched to just 48 hours. The key steps in this dramatic shortening of turnaround time would include the issuance of a smart card to procurement agents, installation of an electronic data machine (EDM) at the mandi backed by the e-payment system RuPay, quick generation of MIS and reports and, finally, e-approvals by the procurement agency.

The process enables the instantaneous capture of milk quantity and quality data, converting them into an accounting entry that credits the farmer’s account, and a micro-ATM or cash dispenser is made available for farmers to draw money from. Similar initiatives can be undertaken for other sectors, such as sugar and fruits and vegetables, with the bank participating at every stage of the supply chain. Banks can offer cash-flow-based working capital and loans to farmers like cattle loans and unsecured personal loans. Back-end systems can capture the entire cash flow and income profile of farmers, to ensure there’s no compromise on credit standards. From our experience, for small and medium farmers who were given credit, there was a fivefold increase in savings balances. Thus, an entire culture of savings and banking took root. However, rural banking is not just about providing customised innovations. There’s a large market for an entire suite of products — car loans, two-wheeler loans, tractor loans, light commercial vehicle loans, small working capital loans to traders, personal loans, gold loans, commodity finance, along with the more conventional agricultural credit. There’s also a strong demand for savings products, ranging from basic savings accounts to recurring deposits and life and general insurance products. Of course, ticket sizes are smaller, but break-even thresholds for branches are similar to urban branches as costs are lower. Digitisation of banking has helped access a wider range of customers in rural India. For a rural population that is mobile-enabled to a large extent, digital applications (wallets, mobile-to-mobile payments) are adding to transaction traffic by leaps and bounds. This segment is growing at twice the rate of urban India, ensuring a growth for banks in these geographies higher than market growth for the next decade. This is not to deny that challenges remain in growing the rural markets. Financial literacy is low and incomes and livelihoods are volatile. Any credit disbursal at the grassroot level must have a holistic approach. Along with timely credit, it’s critical to conduct financial literacy and credit counselling programmes, offer skills training to enhance income generation, form self-help groups and fund these groups for income-generating activities. This enables the delivery of viable credit to the rural poor in a sustainable manner and at the same time inculcates saving and banking habits. Extending finance to the rural markets has traditionally been viewed as a social obligation enforced through diktat rather than the lure of profits. Yet, as we have discovered at HDFC Bank by successfully implementing all of these strategies, there’s a veritable treasure trove in these markets. All you need is the right mix of technology, business model and outreach through targeted programmes to tap these opportunities. Bharat is rapidly catching up with India, which is a political, economic and social necessity. The fabric of society is changing, consequent to the convergence of media, telecom and computing, leaving us with no option.

RRBs are sponsored by public sector banks. Private sector lender Jammu and Kashmir Bank, too, has sponsored one RRB in Jammu and Kashmir. The country has 56 RRBs sponsored by 22 banks. The total number of PMJDY accounts increased from 4.31 crore as on November 9 to 4.37 crore by November 23. The growth in the number of accounts was more in rural branches than the urban ones. Post-demonetisation, 4.64 lakh PMJDY accounts were opened in rural branches and 1.12 lakh accounts in urban branches. Bank of Maharashtra’s RRB added 2.3 lakh new PMJDY accounts. As a result of this, the zero-balance accounts, which were at 13.79 per cent as on November 9, jumped to 50.77 per cent by November 23. Balance up The balance in PMJDY accounts increased from ?7,630.75 crore as on November 9 to ?1,3507 crore by November 23, registering a growth of 77 per cent.

13," Welcome to National Institute of Rural Banking A C-PEC acredited, IIBF recognized Institute Home About Us Vision & Mission Management Our Client Institutions Infrastructure The Roadmap for future Finances of NIRB and Course Fee Academics Faculty Programme Advisory Committee Programme Designing Team Programmes Offered Fee Structure Training Methodology Educational Activities International Exchange / Study visits E-Learning E-Test Advisory Service Gallery Contact Us Introduction: National Institute for Rural Banking (NIRB) Bangalore has, over the past 25 years years, emerged as one of the leading Training and Management Development Institutions in the country for the Rural Banking Sector, offering a variety of training programmes to the personnel of Rural Financing Institutions in general and particularly to the Co-operative Credit Institutions and RRBs NIRB is an accredited member of Centre for Professional Excellence (C-PEC) established by Bankers' Institute of Rural Banking (Set up by NABARD), Lucknow, in technical collaboration with giZ of Germany. NIRB is an accredited Institute of The Indian Institute of Banking and Finance (IIBF), Mumbai to conduct (i) '100 hours' Certification programme for the Debt Recovery Agents (ii) Certificate Programme for Business Correspondents and Business Facilitators (iii) Advanced Diploma in Cooperative Banking (iv) Coaching programme for banking personnel appearing for JAIIB and CAIIB examinations. NIRB had some collaborative Training studies with a few foreign countries. The Genesis: NIRB, had its origin in the National Centre for Management Development in Agriculture and Rural Development Banking (NCMDARDB), which was promoted by the National Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks' Federation (NCARDBF) in 1990 and registered as a Public Trust. The initiative for this venture of national importance was taken by two visionaries in the field of cooperative movement viz., Sarvashri B.S.Vishwanathan and P.V.Prabhu, the then Chairman and the Executive Director respectively, of NCARDBF, Mumbai. Though an initial contribution of Rs.10 lakh was made by NCARDBF, major funding support for the initial six years came from the Rabobank Foundation of Rabobank, the Netherlands. Rabobank is a leading Cooperative Bank in the world founded on Raiffeisen principles and ideals. Since 1996-97 NIRB has been functioning on self-supporting basis. The Renaming: In the year 2004, nomenclature of NCMDARDB was changed to National Institute for Rural Banking (NIRB) with a view to bringing about the required focus on the thrust areas of the training imparted by it and incidentally to make it more meaningful.

Rural Banks in those days mainly focused upon the agro sector. Today, commercial banks and Regional rural banks in India are penetrating every corner of the country are extending a helping hand in the growth process of the rural sector in the country. BANKS: FUNCTIONING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL AREAS The area of operation of a majority of the RRBs is limited to a notified area comprising a few districts in a State. SBI has 30 Regional Rural Banks in India known as RRBs. The rural banks of SBI are spread in 13 states extending from Kashmir to Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh to North East. Apart from SBI, there are other few banks which functions for the development of the rural areas in India. Few of them are as follows. Haryana State Cooperative Apex Bank Limited NABARD Sindhanur Urban Souharda Co-operative Bank United Bank of India Syndicate Bank Co-operative bank CO-OPERATIVE BANKS AND RURAL CREDIT The Co-operative bank has a history of almost 100 years. The Co-operative banks are an important constituent of the Indian Financial System, judging by the role assigned to them, the expectations they are supposed to fulfill, their number, and the number of offices they operate. Their role in rural financing continues to be important even today, and their business in the urban areas also has increased phenomenally in recent years mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of primary co-operative banks. Co-operative Banks in India are registered under the Co-operative Societies Act. The RBI also regulates the cooperative bank. They are governed by the Banking Regulations Act 1949 and Banking Laws (Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965. Co-operative banks in India finance rural areas under: Farming Cattle Milk Hatchery Personal finance Institutional Arrangements for Rural Credit (Co-operatives) Short Term Co-operatives Long Term Co-operatives Short Term Co-operatives | District Central Co-operative Banks | State Co-operative Banks | Primary Agriculture Credit Co-operative Societies | Branches Long Term Cooperatives | State Agriculture & Rural Development Banks | Primary Agriculture & Rural Development Banks | Branches Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACSs) An agricultural credit society can be started with 10 or more persons normally belonging to a village or a group of villages. The value of each share is generally nominal so as to enable even the poorest farmer to become a member. The members have unlimited liability, that is each member is fully responsible for the entire loss of the society, in the event of failure. Loans are given for short periods, normally for the harvest season, for carrying on agricultural operation, and the rate of interest is fixed. There are now over 92,000 primary agricultural credit societies in the country with a membership of over 100 million. The primary agricultural credit society was expected to attract deposits from among the well ?to-do members and non-members of the village and thus promote thrift and self-help. It should give loans and advances to needy members mainly out of these deposits. Central Co-operative Banks (CCBs) The central co-operative banks are located at the district headquarters or some prominent town of the district. These banks have a few private individuals also who provide both finance and management. The central co-operative banks have three sources of funds, Their own share capital and reserves Deposits from the public and Loans from the state co-operative banks Their main function is to lend to primary credit society apart from that, central coopertive banks have been undertaking normal commercial banking business also, such as attracting deposits from the general public and lending to the needy against proper securities. There are now 367 central co-operative banks. State Co-operative Banks (SCBs) The state Co-operative Banks, now 29 in number, they finance, co-ordinate and control the working of the central Co-operative Banks in each state. They serve as the link between the Reserve bank and the general money market on the one side and the central co-operative and primary societies on the other. They obtain their funds mainly from the general public by way of deposits, loans and advances from the Reserve Bank and they are own share capital and reserves. COMMERCIAL BANKS AND RURAL CREDIT The commercial banks at present provide short term crop loans account for nearly 45 to 47% of the total loans given and disbursed by the commercial banks. Term loans for varying periods are given for purchasing pump sets, tractors and other agricultural machinery, for construction of wells and tube well, for development of fruit and garden crops, for leveling and development of land, for purchase of ploughs, animals, etc. commercial banks also extend loans for allied activities viz., for dairying, poultry, piggery, bee keeping, fisheries and others. These loans come to 15 to 16%. Commercial Banks and Small Farmers The commercial banks identifying the small farmers through Small Farmers Development Agencies (SFDA) set up in various districts and group them into various categories for credit support so as to enable them to become bible cultivators. As regard small cultivators near urban areas and irrigation facilities, commercial banks can help them to go in for vegetable cultivation or combine it with small poultry farming and maintaing of one or two milch cattle. IRDP and commercial banks Since October 1980, the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) has been extended to all the blocks in the country and the commercial banks have been asked by the government of India to finance IRDP. The lead banks have to prepare banking plans and allocate the responsibility of financing the identified beneficiaries among the participating banks. Commercial banks have been asked to finance all economically backward people identified by government agencies. REGIONAL RURAL BANKS AND RURAL CREDIT The Narasimham committee on rural credit recommended the establishment of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) on the ground that they would be much better suited than the commercial banks or co-operative banks in meeting the needs of rural areas. Accepting the recommendations of the Narasimham committee, the government passed the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976. The main objective of RRBs is to provide credit and other facilities particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisians and small entrepreneurs and develop agriculture, trade, commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas. The progress of RRBs in the initial stage was quite rapid. For instance, the Sixth Five-year plan(1980-85) had envisaged the setting up of 170 RRBs covering 270 districts by the end of march 1985.The target was exceeded. There are now 196 RRBs in 23 states of the country with 14,200 branches. Structure of regional rural bank The establishment of the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) was initiated in 1975 under the provisions of the ordinance promulgated on 26.9.1975 and thereafter Section 3(1) of the RRB Act, 1976. The issued capital of RRBs is shared by Central Government, sponsor bank and the State Government in the proportion of 50%, 35% and 15% respectively. RRBs established with the explicit objective of: * Bridging the credit gap in rural areas * Check the outflow of rural deposits to urban areas * Reduce regional imbalances and increase rural employment generation ROLE OF RBI IN RURAL CREDIT Since it was set up in 1934, RBI has been taking keen interest in expanding credit to the rural sector. After NABARD was set up as the apex bank for agriculture and rural development, RBI has been taking a series of steps for providing timely and adequate credit through NABARD. Scheduled commercial banks excluding foreign banks have been forced to supplement NABARDs efforts-through the stipulation that 40percent of net bank credit should go to the priority sector, out of which at least 18 percent of net bank credit should flow to agriculture. Besides, it is mandatory that any shortfall in fulfilling the 40 percent target or the 18 percent sub-target would have to go to the corpus Rural Infrastructure Development Fund(RIDF).RBI has also taken steps in recent years to strengthen institutional mechanisms such as recapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and setting up of local area banks(LABs). Micro-Finance Micro-finance is a novel approach to ""banking with poor""as they attempt to combine lower transaction costs and high degree of repayments.The major thrust of these micro-finance initiatives is through the setting up of Self Help Groups (SHGs),Non-Governmental organizations(NGOs),Credit Unions etc. Kisan(Farmers') Credit Card Another notable development in recent years is the introduction of Kisan Credit Cards(KCC) in 1998-99.The purpose of the Kisan Credit Cards(KCC) scheme is to facilities short term credit to farmers.The scheme has gained popularity and its implementation has been taken up by 27 commercial banks, 187 RRBs and 334 Central cooperative banks. Agricultural Insurance As Agricultural is highly susceptible to risks such as drought, flood, pests etc.It is necessary to protect the farmers from natural calamities and ensure their credit eligibility from the next season. Towards this purpose, the Government of India introduced a comprehensive crop insurance scheme throught the country in 1985 covering major cereal crops, oilseeds and pulses. Among commercial crops, seven crops viz., sugarcane potato, cotton, ginger, onion, turmeric and chillies are presently covered. MARKETING OF MUTUAL FUND UNITS - RRBS With a view to expanding the scope of business of RRBs and considering that marketing of Mutual Fund (MF) units provides a profitable avenue for banks, it has been decided by RBI on 17th May 2006 to allow Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) to undertake marketing of units of Mutual Funds, as agents. Accordingly, RRBs may, with approval of their Board of Directors, enter into agreements with Mutual Funds for marketing their units subject to the following terms and conditions: * The bank should only act as an agent of the customers, forwarding applications of the investors for purchase / sale of MF units to the Mutual Fund / Registrar Transfer Agents. * The purchase of MF units should be at the risk of customers and without the bank guaranteeing any assured return. * The bank should not acquire such units of Mutual Fund from the secondary market. * The bank should not buy back units of Mutual Funds from their customers. * The bank holding custody of MF units on behalf of their customers should ensure that its own investment and investments belonging to their customers are kept distinct from each other. * Retailing of units of Mutual Funds may be confined to some select branches of the bank to ensure better control. * The bank should comply with the extant KYC/ AML guidelines in respect of the applicants. * The RRBs should put in place adequate and effective control mechanisms in consultation with their sponsor banks. CONCLUSION RRBs' performance in respect of some important indicators was certainly better than that of commercial banks or even cooperatives. RRBs have also performed better in terms of providing loans to small and retail traders and petty non-farm rural activities. In recent years, they have taken a leading role in financing Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and other micro-credit institutions and linking such groups with the formal credit sector. RRBs should really be strengthened and provided with more resources with which they can undertake more of these important activities. And most certainly they should be kept apart from a profit-oriented corporate motivation that would reduce their capacity to provide much needed financial services to the rural areas, including to agriculture. Ideally, the best use of the resources raised by RRBs through deposits would be through extensive cross-subsidisation. This, in turn, really requires an apex body that would cover and oversee all the RRBs, something like a National Rural Bank of India (NRBI). The number of rural branches should be increased rather than reduced; they should be encouraged to develop more sophisticated methods of credit delivery to meet the changing needs of farming; and most of all, there should be greater coordination between district planning authorities, panchayati raj institutions and the banks operating in rural areas. Only then will the RRBs fulfill the promise that is so essential for rural development. Ms. E.

Suprotip Ghosh Print Edition: Dec 8, 2013 Dipali Patil (left), banking correspondent in a Maharashtra village, handles gadgets needed for her job with ease. Photographs by Danesh Jassawala Malubai Maruti Takde, a 55-year-old grandmother in a Maharashtra village, walks past a sugarcane field as the sun sets over low hills some distance away. She stops near a haystack to meet Dipali Sardar Patil, who fishes out a mobile phone and biometric scanner from a bag, punches a few numbers, hands over some money to Takde and walks away. It's a routine that is repeated almost every other week. Takde either deposits or withdraws a little cash from Patil for a saree, a gift for her grandchildren or just to go to the local fair. Patil is a twenty something mother of two whose husband is a peon in the Vamte village panchayat. She speaks little English and lives in a traditional house close to a field, far from the hi-tech world of India's cities. But she handles the gizmos in her hand with unusual flair. She says the gadgets have helped change her life in many ways: they have given her more confidence and taken her out to meet a lot more people. ""Bluetooth se connect hota hai (They are connected through Bluetooth),"" she says, with the air of a professional. Her tech-savvy manner and professionalism may seem incongruous, but they are not that unusual. Shahji Tukaram Patil (seated, right), a banking representative in Maharashtra, says the nearest bank is miles from his village. Patil is one of thousands of so-called Business Correspondents, or local bank representatives, who are taking banking to the doorstep of people in far-flung villages across the country. They help mostly illiterate Indian villagers understand the basics of banking in line with the Reserve Bank of India's 2009 guidelines on bringing the unbanked population into the fold of banking. The central bank said the process of financial inclusion involved access to banking and credit markets as well as financial education. Though still a relatively new concept, India already has more than 200,000 business correspondents who are as diverse as their rural customers : they could be carpenters, school teachers, village clerks, farmers or rural women with no education whatsoever. Take Dagdu Kisan Sutar, a 28-year-old carpenter from Mahavade village, for instance. Sutar came back to his village after a stint in the city in the construction industry, and became a business correspondent about seven months ago. The decision made sense: Mahavade lies about 10 km from the nearest bank that stands between thatched huts and traditional village houses with colourful motifs. Already, Sutar has about 70 customers who he helps when he's not bent over his carpentry tools in his workshop near his house. Zohair Mustaq Qureshi says many of his customers are students who work part-t ime and save a rupee a day. Many business correspondents juggle two or sometimes even more jobs, but some make a living from doorstep banking . Take 40-year-old Ramkishore Yadav from Madhya Pradesh's Hoshangabad district, for example. He was part of the non-medical staff at a private hospital in Kesla town for some years before he started a small computer kiosk to teach local youth the basics of computers. About two years ago, he came across a State Bank of India advertisement in a local newspaper for business correspondents in this predominantly tribal district. A few phone calls later, Yadav was in a training session where he learnt how to open accounts and operate a biometric machine that reads fingerprints. Back in Hoshangabad, he started working with the local population: initially, he used to go to villages with State Bank of India employees, who would organise awareness campaigns. But later he began bringing in more clients on his own. Yadav's efforts have paid off: today, he has close to 7,200 customers under his belt. Do his clients understand deposits and withdrawals, or tenors and interests? Yadav says they were mystified initially, but understood the concepts quickly. It didn't take them long to start coming with the cards, and depositing or withdrawing their cash. He says most of the people who come to him are labourers looking to withdraw money. Only one in four people deposit money, mostly small amounts between Rs100 to Rs200. Another business correspondent, Malkhan Singh of Madhya Pradesh's Panna district, says it typically takes at least a year to convince customers about the benefits of banking. Singh, who comes from a family of farmers, says his mode of operations is to visit gram sabhas in every one of Panna's 20 villages and explain the virtues of banking to villagers. Being a business correspondent isn't the most lucrative business: they earn as little as 50 paise a transaction and there is little room to increase the transactions because there are only so many people in an area. But people are attracted to the job for other reasons. Archana Yuvraj Rohile of Mahavade village was not deterred by the small size of the transactions. She used to work in Kolhapur, but did not get enough time with her husband and two children. She returned to the village where she now does household work and tends to livestock until late afternoon when her husband leaves for work at a spinning mill. That's when she finds time to start her job as a village banker. ""I ask my kids to watch TV and go out for work,"" she says. ""People call me madam in the village, because I tell them what to do. The government has appointed us for our benefit, that's why I do it."" Villagers say banking correspondents have changed their lives. Several remote areas in India do not have a bank and only a small percentage of the population has a bank account. Earlier, pigmy agents, or agents of microbranches of banks who travel from village to village, were the only contact points for a bank. If people missed them when the agents came around, there was no alternative but to wait until they came back. Not any more. ""Now they (business correspondents) are always around,"" says Ravindra Lohar, who runs a small shop selling halwa and mobile recharge coupons. The numbers are telling. Banking correspondents have opened 8.12 crore savings accounts with deposits of Rs 1,822 crore across the country already. Many of their customers are farmers, small shopkeepers, labourers and rural women who have never had access to a bank until now. Banking correspondents say most of their customers are women, some who save in tens of rupees. Zohair Mushtaq Qureshi says many of his depositors are students who also work part-time and deposit as little as one rupee a day. ""We don't have a bank in our village, the nearest bank is many kilometres away,"" says Shahji Tukaram Patil, a 32-year-old father of two sitting in a two-storey wooden house in a Maharasthtra village. Banks say they normally look for people with an entrepreneurship streak when they appoint business correspondents. Given the small transaction amounts, it is not always easy to make a lot of money in such rural banking. Nevertheless, according to industry estimates, some entrepreneurial representatives can make up to Rs50,000 a month. ""One of the biggest reasons why we pick up some people is an entrepreneurial streak. It is not a nine-to- five job,"" says Abhishek Pandit, director, business services, AISECT, a non-profit organisation that trains business correspondents. ""We want him to serve the villagers; so only if he is entrepreneurial, will he succeed.""

He is born under debts, lives in debts, dies in debts and leaves debts for his heirs. The basic reason of his endless debts is the ancestral obligations; which are regarded sacred and paid till his last breath. The heavy expenditure at social functions, deaths and marriages force him to be down under the feet of traditional moneylender who had been exploiting him by charging high rates of interest. The farmers who fall once into the hands of the moneylender are never debt free. Image Source: egov.eletsonline.com In the whole country a network of co-operative societies was spread but the entire needs of rural people could not be satisfied. They also adversely affected them because of corruption, favouritism and inefficiency. Hence the establishment of Rural Banks was defined as “To fulfill the aims of institutionalising the credit structure and enhancing its area and coverage.” Establishment of co-operative societies was no doubt a relief to the poor. But they could not meet the entire needs of the rural people. They could provide little service to the community because of corruption, nepotism and inefficien­cy which infected them. They were, however, able to make a dent and money­lenders share in the total lending came down to 40% in 1960-62 from 70% in 1951-52. 14 leading banks of the country were nationalised in 1969. The object was to give banking facilities to the neglected sections of the society specially the poor farmers, landless labourers and artisans. The nationalised banks expanded their branches in rural areas. Despite this a large number of people were still left uncovered and unfacilitated. On August 18, 1975 a conference of Chief Minister and State Finance Ministers was held in Delhi to study the credit needs of rural people. The conference decided to give these banks a different shape other than the commercialised and co-operative banks and the staff be given facilities in regard to the local conditions in various states and regions. The President accepted the Chief Minister’s Conference recommendations and made an ordinance on Sept. 26, 1975 to setup the regional rural banks in the country. In reply to it fifty banks were opened on Oct. 2, 1975 covering 9 districts of various states. The share capital of banks was made up by central government, state government and commercialised bank in ratio of 50%, 15% and 35% respectively. Before April 1, 1977 a target of 5&regional banks was set up. The aim’s and objects of Rural Banks are as follows : 1. These banks will provide credits to rural population to make it more productive and raise the level of life. 2. They will identify the credit needs of each region to regulate produc­tivity and avoid wastefulness. 3. The banks will help eradication of poverty and eliminate the financial constraints that mar the progress of poor farmers and artisans. 4. These banks will combine the better features of both the systems of commercial banks and the co-operative societies avoiding inabilities that are present in them. 5. They will also enhance the membership of primary societies and expand it substantially. 6. They will develop the tendency to repay regularly the government loans. The proper climate for recovery of loans will be created and non­payments will be discouraged. 7. The rural banks will also help rural industries, animal husbandries, poultries and fishery. These banks will evolve an economic structure of rural India to make the use of the fruits of science and technology as their motto is “Banks exist for the people and not people for the banks.” The government has contributed 15% of the initial capital and 15% is proposed to be raised from the local people. But this idea was dropped. The transactions of these banks will be made in the regional languages so as to make them truly people’s banks. Rural banks have been established to meet the needs of the weaker sections of society. It will eliminate rural indebtedness. It will save the rural population from the clutches of the clever moneylenders. It will also promote economic development by providing the much needed funds to marginal and poor farmers. The possibilities of lack of funds to start small-scale industries will be eliminated. Easy loans will be provided to them on low rates of interests without having substantial securities. The bank staff will specially be made rural minded so that the villagers may not feel reluctant to partonise these banks. The efforts will be made to form banking habits in villagers.

Sub-K attempts to change this with a first of its kind rural distribution model coupled with an effective mobile technology based transactional platform. It enables residents of rural areas to open bank accounts and carry out transactions for several financial products with utmost ease. Babla Sharan, the former Executive Director &amp; COO at Sub-K explains how this is done via reverse innovation in the rural banking sector. How it all began Traditionally, most financial institutions offer standardized solutions to their customers, maintaining similar rules regarding minimum balance, irrespective of the area of operation. This coupled with problems such as poor infrastructure, poor roads, electricity and connectivity in these areas, makes it highly inconvenient for people to travel to towns, or even carry out operations from home. This results in general disillusionment and dismissal of financial institutions by the rural residents leaving 70% of rural population without any means to save or invest their earnings. “With a desire to bridge the gap between the urban and rural community, Sub-K was born”, said Babla. The goal of Sub-K is to empower the common man with the means to save and invest in solutions, customized to his need. Babla explains that after regular interaction with a large number of rural residents, he found out that traditional modes of investment were not favored by them. A majority preferred to invest in farm animals or sometimes even vegetation in a small piece of land, as opposed to insurance or mutual funds. This knowledge led to the inception of customized micro-products suitable for the rural community, complete with smaller payment cycles. Reverse innovation as adopted by Sub-K is an example of how companies can produce inexpensive goods and services to meet the needs of the emerging markets. It reveals that businesses should NOT follow a one-size-fits-all approach. It is of utmost importance to “localize” a business, and provide customized solutions to the target market, based on their behaviour, tastes, geography, and so on. The Thousand Principal “By keeping our solution simple”, says Babla, “we reach them through our agents in their vicinity (less than 1 km radius). And we help them transact in amounts of less than 1000 INR, without having to spend more than 1000 paisa. Of course, every agent is expected to serve 1000 customers.“ This means that villages with only a few thousand population can now open accounts with reputed banks using Sub-K’s technology platform. The accounts are called no-frills accounts -or basic savings bank accounts, where there is no need for a minimum deposit and no money is required to open the account. An account number is issued to every account holder who can save as less as 50 INR every now and then for a rainy day. Through a network called Basic Convenience Outlets (BCO), the company provides residents of rural, urban and semi-urban areas with access to services like banking, NREGA, utility payments and prepaid mobile top-ups with its patented mobile & biometric based real-time online transaction engine. Infact, Sub-K was the first company that offered online mobile banking in remote locations – even those places where data networks weren’t available. The distribution model – using the agent as the go-to-portal ensured the trust and stickiness that is crucial for uptake of such services. The Way Forward Reverse innovation plays an important role in promoting financial growth, especially in emerging markets and developing countries. Globalized strategy leveraged through reverse innovation can help larger organizations (in the west) enter emerging markets with solutions that are simple but relevant. Businesses can leverage the power of reverse innovation, similar to Sub-K by creating a simplistic transactional model combined with easy-to use technology.

There are around 600,000 numbers of villages in India out of which only 32,500 villages have banking facilities. If India needs to grow, then this number has to significantly row. RBI has prepared a roadmap for ensuring that all villages with a population of over 2,000 will have access to financial services through a banking outlet, not necessarily a bank branch, by March 2012. Banking in rural areas can provide much needed push to our economy. An average Indian farmer has nowhere to go to but to money lender for his credit requirements. Consider a simple case where a farmer harvests a bumper crop. As there is no way of saving the money, the farmer is forced to buy gold in order to save money. This conversion of cash to gold is a lost opportunity not only for banks but for the entire economy as a whole. This money could have been for used for productive purposes. Moreover, investment in gold is illiquid form of investment. If the farmer needs to borrow money, he goes to money lender who charges an interest rate of 30-40% pledging his precious gold as security. If there was a bank in his area, he would have deposited his money in the bank account earning interest on it. Also, bank would have charged less interest rate, at least 4 times, for loan disbursal. Let’s look at some numbers highlighting the state of rural banking in India. India has a population of 1.2 billion. According to industry estimates there are about 335 million bank accounts. Considering, people with multiple accounts, there are around 200 million Indians who can be considered having bank account. Of this, industry estimates that there are 18 million accounts in rural areas. This is a very small number when 60% (0.6*1.2 = 720 million) of population resides in rural areas contributing to 40% of the GDP. RBI has taken certain steps to increase banking facilities in the rural areas mandating banks to open at least 25% of their new branches in un-banked rural areas with a population over 2,000 and offer priority sector lending. Many banks have taken initiatives in spreading their wings in rural areas. First step would be win trust of the people. They will have to convince the people that their money is safe with them rather than money lender. The urban model which has high staff cost will not work in rural area. Banks will need to hire local people who understand the needs of people such that local people feel comfortable with them. The key to success would be to find innovative approaches to reach the rural masses. It is not feasible to build brick and mortar branch in every village. Many banks have opened branches depending on the population of the village, some use business correspondent while some use mobile vans which visit different banks offering credit as well as other banking facilities. SBI has opened biometric ATMs in the rural areas which captures user’s thumb impression on an electronic chip in the debit card, enabling him to make withdrawals with a simple swipe. ICICI bank has tied up with Vodafone and SBI has tied up with bharti airtel to offer mobile banking services to rural users. The telecom operator’s customer service outlets and retailers serve as contact points. Also, with the help of the mobiles, they will be able to remit money. Providing Infrastructure and technological connectivity still remains a challenge. Amid these challenges, there is tremendous potential for banks in rural areas. Banks will not be profitable overnight but in the longer run it provides a great opportunity. It is absolutely essential to provide banking services in rural areas for achieving inclusive growth. Role of government will be very critical in supporting the banks in this initiative.

PRINT Rural Retail Banking in India: 2020 Faculty Contributor : Jayadev M., Associate Professor and Roger Moser, Visiting Faculty Student Contributors : Madhulika Kaul and Charvi Tandon Financial inclusion is seen as one of the means for overall economic development of a country. The growth of the rural retail banking industry fosters financial inclusion by providing financial products and services to people in the farthest reaches of the country. In India, even now the rural areas lack access to basic financial services. However, the recent emergence of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and non-banking financial corporations (NBFCs) in this sector has led to a commendable growth in the industry. This study aims to identify the most probable scenarios for the industry in the year 2020 using the Delphi study approach. The issue of rural retail banking is extremely topical. Over the past few decades, while urban retail banking has seen a lot of growth, rural areas have continued to suffer from insufficient access to financial services. This is mainly due to the requirement of asset deeds, identity and income proofs among other documents by banks and FIs and absence of enough branches in these areas. The high cost of conventional banking is an additional impediment to the realisation of financial inclusion. Our study has tried to understand how the Indian rural retail banking industry (industry) will develop over the next decade. We aimed to identify the institutional environment of this industry in the coming decade as well as the activities that banks and other financial institutions (FIs) in India will need to invest in to realize the full potential of this market. Rural Retail Banking The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had a mandate to promote rural credit and banking by virtue of the provisions of Section 54 of the RBI Act. Through the State Bank of India (SBI) Act in 1955, the SBI was made an important organisation for extending rural credit to supplement the efforts of cooperative institutions. These cooperative institutions, better known as primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) 1 also provide other agricultural inputs to the farmers. The next step to supplement the efforts of cooperatives and commercial banks was the establishment of regional rural banks in 1975 in different states with equity participation from commercial banks, central and state governments. In 1982, to consolidate the various arrangements made by the RBI to promote/supervise institutions and channel credit to rural areas, the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) was established. 2 Currently, according to a series of estimates and market studies the number of rural bank branches is 31,727. This is 39.7% of the total number of bank branches in the country. The number of no-frill accounts is 28.23 million. There are only 54 savings accounts for every 100 persons in rural areas and only 26% of rural citizens with an annual income of less than Rs. 50000 have a bank account. In the same income bracket, only 13% farmers have ever availed of bank loans while 54% have used non-institutional and other forms of lending 3 . Thus, there is sufficient need for extending financial services to the rural areas. Exhibit 1 details the supply and demand side factors that challenge the growth of rural retail banking. Exhibit 1 Factors influencing demand and supply in the rural retail banking industry A number of innovations and experiments have been initiated to bridge the gap between the rural population and the formal retail banking system. Local area banks (LABs) an initiative that attempted to mobilize rural savings by local institutions and make them available for investment locally. As of 2005, only four LABs were functioning in the country. 4 The major handicap in their business model was the lack of a re-financing facility that hindered their ability to lend at better rates. Self-help groups (SHGs) with bank linkages was another indigenously developed banking model. Being a savings - first model, credit discipline is a norm of the group; besides joint liability and social collateral make such groups bankable in the eyes of bankers. The linkages are achieved through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other intermediaries, and this has formed the basis of the micro-finance movement in India. However, the absence of NGOs in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and those in the north-east has been a stumbling block in spreading this model in these states. The alternative to the above model has been the NGO/MFI bulk-lending model where funds were placed at the disposal of NGOs or MFIs for lending to SHGs or other groups and even to individuals. However, this model was not able to scale-up due to the low capitalization of the NGO/MFIs and their inability to undertake financial intermediation. Also, this meant that the formal banks had a two-level exposure and this further reduced the potential for scaling-up. In the partnership model, the MFI evaluates, recommends, originates the loans, helps in disbursal and subsequently tracks and collects the loans. However, the loans sit on the books of the bank and not of the MFI. This model has overcome the constraints of capitalization of the MFI and the double exposure that the banks were subjected to. Other recent innovations include the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) that enables the farmer to get loans over a three to five year period as a revolving credit entitlement, thus, providing them control over their cash flows and reduced transaction costs for both the banks and the farmers. However, the biggest roadblock has been the creation of point of sale (POS) kiosks and acceptance of the cards. The business facilitator and the business correspondent models (Exhibit 2) have been other innovations in this field. Institutions or persons, who interface between the rural poor and banks, are leveraged to provide support services under well-defined terms and conditions by way of contractual arrangements. In the case of the business facilitator model, as per the law, these agencies provide basic support services such as customer identification, collection of information/applications, credit appraisal, marketing etc. Under the business correspondent model, specific agencies e.g. MFIs, NBFCs etc. also provide disbursal of small value credit as “pass through” agents for the parent bank. Exhibit 2 Business correspondent model Delphi Study Approach The Delphi study approach has been used to identify and understand the different scenarios that will emerge for rural retail banking in 2020. It is a method for the “systematic solicitation and collation of judgments on a particular topic through a set of carefully designed sequential questionnaires interspersed with summarized information and feedback of opinions derived from earlier responses” Opinions about a certain problem or task are solicited through mail or electronic means in a geographically dispersed network. The main features of this approach are anonymity to prevent influence of any group members, controlled feedback due to multiple rounds of survey summaries and a statistical output as a final response. It being an iterative and expert based system, the Delphi study approach is regarded as a research technique especially suitable for complex issues. For our study this was particularly relevant since we wished to understand how the rural retail banking industry will evolve over the next decade. Several experts in the field of retail banking, rural banking, rural finance and microfinance were approached through a web-tool and the final opinions of the various experts were studied and analyzed to reach our conclusion and recommendations. Future Trends in Rural Retail Banking Based on our secondary research and interviews with experts in the industry 20 projections were formulated for the possible scenario in the industry in the year 2020. These projections can largely be classified into – outcome and enabler projections. Exhibit 3 lists out the 20 projections. Exhibit 3 Projections for 2020 Outcome Projections These projections concern the actual state of affairs in the industry in 2020. They are a description of a specific situation in 2020 rather than an activity by a specific player in the society. These projections are further categorised under the following four fronts: Political scenario – A strict regulatory regime is expected for the industry in the future, accompanied with increasing changes in norms and frameworks, primarily, the removal of the cap on interest rates as imposed by the RBI at present. Economic scenario – The greater share of the market will be serviced by the MFIs and NBFCs. A collaborative alliance with internationally banks will be the primary source of funds and other resources for the MFIs and NBFCs. Social scenario – Urbanization and migration from the rural areas would substantially decrease the size of the market for the FIs. Even the consumers would become more aware and knowledgeable about the various financial services and products and hence, would expect one-stop shop solutions from the FIs. Technological scenario – Consumer databases providing information about the credit history and financial dealings of the consumers and thus enabling the FIs to design customized products and better manage their credit portfolio will be put in place. In addition, mobile phones would become the means of the primary delivery mechanism in the rural areas owing to their high penetration and reach and low costs. Outcome Projections The other kinds of projections for the industry in 2020 were the enabler projections. These projections pertain to the stakeholders in the industry – customers, suppliers, competitors, government and society. These projections reflect the actions that are needed to be taken by these shareholders to enable the outcome projections. Analysis of the Projections The projections formulated for the year 2020 were analysed using the Delphi approach. The various experts who took part in the study were asked to rate the projections on the following counts: The probability of occurrence of the respective projection in 2020. The impact on the industry if the projection is true. The scale used was a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 where 1 signifies very low impact and 5 signifies very high impact. The desirability of the occurrence of the projection. The scale used for was a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 where 1 signifies very low desirability and 5 signifies very high desirability. Based on the responses of the participants in the study two metrics were calculated for each projection – consensus and convergence. Consensus Consensus signifies the consensus among the experts as to the probability of occurrence of the projections. The variance among the responses of all the experts is taken as a measure of the consensus among the experts. A variance of up to 25 is taken as a sign of strong consensus, from 26 to 40 is taken as a sign of moderate dissent and greater than 40 is taken as sign of high dissent. Convergence Convergence refers to the changes in the responses of the participants over the period of the study as they studied the responses of the other participants and altered their responses accordingly. It is calculated as the change in absolute deviation of the final responses from the absolute deviation of the initial responses as a percentage of the absolute deviation of the initial responses. An absolute value of convergence up to 10% is taken as moderate convergence, from 11% to 20% is taken as strong convergence and greater than 20% is taken as very strong convergence. Exhibit 4 gives the mean value of probability, impact and desirability and the degree of consensus and convergence for each of the 20 projections. Exhibit 4 Metrics for each projection Conclusion Based on our study we have concluded that the following scenarios are the most probable in the year 2020 for the Indian rural retail banking industry: Consumer awareness – with increased education among the consumers and greater availability of information, the consumer awareness will increase regarding the financial services and products that are present in the market and they will demand one-stop shop solutions for all their financial needs. Consumer databases – the introduction of the UID project has led to the hope and an increasing probability of presence of extensive consumer databases in 2020. These databases will provide information about consumer credit history and financial transactions to enable the FIs to customize products suited to the consumers’ needs. Capitalization of MFIs - there is a low probability that international banks would be the chosen medium of capitalization for the MFIs in 2020. They will be largely capitalized by the local Indian financial markets. This could be owing to the FDI regulations in the country as well as sufficient liquidity in the Indian financial markets. Localized institutions – the FIs would work towards designing localized financial services that would serve to provide one-stop shop solutions and remove information asymmetry because of their local presence. Mobile-based delivery model – the high penetration of mobile services in the country and advances in secure transfer mechanisms will see the rise of mobile phones as delivery platforms by 2020. This will be further augmented by the low costs associated with this delivery mechanism.

The Government of India, the concerned State Government and the bank, which had sponsored the RRB contributed to the share capital of RRBs in the proportion of 50%, 15% and 35%, respectively. The area of operation of the RRBs is limited to notified few districts in a State. The RRBs mobilise deposits primarily from rural/semi-urban areas and provide loans and advances mostly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers , rural artisans and other segments of priority sector. The RBI in 2001 constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr V S Vyas on “Flow of Credit to Agriculture and Related Activities from the Banking System” which examined relevance of RRBs in the rural credit system and the alternatives for making it viable. The consolidation process thus was initiated in the year 2005 as an off-shoot of Dr Vyas Committee Recommendations. First phase of amalgamation was initiated Sponsor Bank-wise within a State in 2005 and the second phase was across the Sponsor banks within a State in 2012. The process was initiated with a view to provide better customer service by having better infrastructure, computerization, experienced work force, common publicity and marketing efforts etc. The amalgamated RRBs also benefit from larger area of operation, enhanced credit exposure limits for high value and diverse banking activities. As a result of amalgamation, number of the RRBs has been reduced from 196 to 64 as on 31 March 2013. The number of branches of RRBs increased to 17856 as on 31 March 2013 covering 635 districts throughout the country. 2 . Performance of RRBs during 2012-13 (1 April 2012 – 31 March 2013) (Provisional) 2.1 Sources of Funds The sources of funds of RRBs comprise of owned fund, deposits, borrowings from NABARD, Sponsor Banks and other sources including SIDBI and National Housing Bank. 2.1.1 Owned Funds The owned funds of RRBs comprising of share capital, share capital deposits received from the shareholders and the reserves stood at 19304 crore as on 31 March 2013 as against 16462 crore as on 31 March 2012; registering a growth of 17.26%. The increase in owned funds to the tune of 2842 crore was mainly on account of accretion to reserves by the profit making RRBs. The share capital and share capital deposits together amounted to 6174 crore of total owned fund while the balance amount of 13130 crore represented reserves. 2.1.2.Recapitalisation of RRBs (a) The Chakrabarty Committee reviewed the financial position of all RRBs in 2010 and recommended for recapitalisation of 40 out of 82 RRBs for strengthening their CRAR to the level of 9 per cent by 31 March 2012. According to the Committee, the remaining RRBs are in a position to achieve the desired level of CRAR on their own. Accepting the recommendations of the committee, the GOI along with other shareholders decided to recapitalise the RRBs by infusing funds to the extent of 2200 Crore. The shareholder wise proportion (GOI/Sponsor Banks/State Governments) is 50:35:15 respectively. (b) As on 31 March 2013, an amount of 2015.86 crore has been released to 37 RRBs in 20 States. The released amount includes GoI’s contribution of 1003.92 crore, State Govt's contribution of 303.59 crore and Sponsor bank's contribution of 708.35 crore. The recapitalisation is complete in respect of 35 RRBs (5 in Odisha , 3 in MP, 2 in Uttarakhand, 2 in Jharkhand, 2 in Chhatisgarh, 2 in Bihar, 2 in Maharashtra, 3 in West Bengal, 5 in Rajasthan and one each in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Tripura, J&K, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat & UT of Puducherry). GoI share 7.99 cr. is pending in respect of Manipur Rural Bank. Mizoram State Government has partially released 0.50 crore in respect of Mizoram Rural Bank and 2.80 crore is pending. Two State Govts. viz. UP(2 RRBs), & J&K (1 RRB) have not released any amount in respect of 3 RRBs operating in their states. Out of 35 fully recapitalised RRBs, 3 RRBs viz. Central Madhya Pradesh GB, Manipur Rural Bank and Mizoram GB have not achieved CRAR of 9 per cent as on 31.3.2013. 2.1.3 Deposits Deposits of RRBs increased from 186336 crore to 211458 crore during the year registering growth rate of 13.48 %. There are Thirty three (33) RRBs having deposits of more than 3000 crore each.

All The Best :) Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) - The History Rural banking in India started since the establishment of banking sector in India. Regional Rural Banks were set up after nationalizations of banks in 1969 when emphasis shifted to providing more credit to weaker sections. Regional Rural Banks were established under the provisions of an Ordinance promulgated on the 26th September 1975 and the RRB Act, 1976 with an objective to ensure sufficient institutional credit for agriculture and other rural sectors. Rural Banks in those days mainly focused upon the Agro Sector. Regional rural banks in India penetrated every corner of the country and extended a helping hand in the growth process of the country. Here is the Complete list of 82 Regional Rural Banks(RRB) in India by Sate wise which are participating in IBPS RRB Exam : Andhra Pradesh Andhra Pradesh Grameena Vikas Bank (APGVB) Andhra Pragathi Grameena Bank Deccan Grameena Bank Chaitanya Godavari Grameena Bank Saptagiri Grameena Bank Arunachal Pradesh Arunachal Pradesh Rural Bank Assam Assam Gramin Vikash Bank Langpi Dehangi Rural Bank Bihar Madhya Bihar Gramin Bank Bihar Kshetriya Gramin Bank Uttar Bihar Kshetriya Gramin Bank Kosi Kshetriya Gramin Bank Samastipur Kshetriya Gramin Bank Chhattisgarh Chhattisgarh Gramin Bank .

As Gandhiji said “Real India lies in Villages,” and village economy is the backbone of Indian economy. Without the upliftment of the rural economy as well as the rural people of our country, the objectives of economic planning cannot be achieved. In fact, the real growth of Indian economy lied in the freeing of rural masses from acute poverty, unemployment, and socio-economic backwardness. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are oriented towards meeting the needs of the weaker sections of the rural population consisting of : Small and marginal farmers, Agricultural labourers, Artisans, Small entrepreneurs, Mobalise deposits from rural households RRBs are expected to make credit available to rural households besides inspiring carefulness. Put it simple to ensure sufficient institutional credit for agriculture and other rural sectors. The Credit Delivery System : Grant of credit at cheap or concessional rates Lending to individuals belonging to weaker sections without checking the viability of the activity proposed to be undertaken. The Operational Area of RRB "" The area of operation of RRBs is limited to the area as notified by GoI covering one or more districts in the State. Ownership of RRBs : RRBs are jointly owned by Government of India (GOI), the concerned State Government and Sponsor Banks (27 scheduled commercial banks and one State Cooperative Bank); the issued capital of a RRB is shared by the owners in the proportion of 60%, 20% and 20% respectively. Reform Process - RRBs In order to provide access to low-cost banking facilities to the poor, the Narasimham Working Group (1975) proposed the establishment of a new set of banks, as institutions which ""combine the local feel and the familiarity with rural problems which the cooperatives possess and the degree of business organization, ability to mobilize deposits, access to central money markets and modernized outlook which the commercial banks have"". RRBs started their development process on 2nd October 1975 with the formation of a single bank (Prathama Grameen Bank). As on 31 March 2006, there were 133 RRBs (post-merger) covering 525 districts with a network of 14,494 branches. RBI Assistance With a view to facilitate RRBs operations, the RBI gave RRBs direct access to refinance assistance at a concessional rate of three per cent below the bank rate. Allowed to maintain a lower level of SLR than commercial banks. Allowed to pay half per cent more interest on all deposits except those of three years and above. Sponsor banks IDBI, NABARD, SIDBI, and other FIs are statutorily required under the RRBs Act to provide managerial and financial assistance to RRBs. Evaluation of RRBs The Committee constituted by the RBI in June 1977 to valuate the performance of RRBs concluded that with some modifications in their organisation and structure. The Committee to Review Arrangements for Institutional Credit for Agriculture and Rural Development which inter alia examined the role of RRBs in the rural development work, suggested the following : Preference for opening bank branches than commercial banks The eligible business of commercial banks’ rural branches may be transferred to RRBs. The losses in initial years of RRBs may be met by shareholders and equity capital should also be raised. The various facilities provided by sponsor banks should continue for 10 yrs in each case Concessionary refinance by RBI should be continued The control, regulation, and promotional responsibilities should be transferred from the GOI to RBI or NABARD. Regulatory Control RRBs are allowed up to December 31, 2000 to maintain cash reserves at 3 per cent of their demand and time liabilities. A number of measures were taken since 1995 not only to make RRBs viable but also to enable them to function effectively. Apart from recapitalisation and infusion of equity, the measures include : Deregulation of interest rates on advance and deposits of above one year maturity; rationalization of branches; and relaxation of norms relating to investments by RRBs. In 1998-99 NABARD introduced several policy measures for improving overall performance. They are : Quarterly / half yearly review of RRBs especially weak ones by the sponsor banks Merger of RRBs coming under a sponsor bank and operating in contiguous areas Off-site surveillance Framing of Appointment and Promotion rules (1998) for the staff of RRBs Introduction of Kissan Credit Cards for provision of credit to farmers.

29," Regional Rural Bank - Wikipedia Regional Rural Bank From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Regional Rural Banks (also RRBs ) are local level banking organizations operating in different States of India . They have been created with a view to serve primarily the rural areas of India with basic banking and financial services . However, RRBs may have branches set up for urban operations and their area of operation may include urban areas too. The area of operation of RRBs is limited to the area as notified by Government of India covering one or more districts in the State. RRBs also perform a variety of different functions. RRBs perform various functions in following heads • Providing banking facilities to rural and semi-urban areas. Carrying out government operations like disbursement of wages of MGNREGA workers, distribution of pensions etc. • Providing Para-Banking facilities like locker facilities, debit and credit cards. Contents 1 History 2 Recapitalization of Regional Rural Banks 3 Organizational Structure 4 Amalgamation 5 Legal Existence and Protection 6 References History [ edit ] Regional Rural Banks were established under the provisions of an Ordinance passed on September 1975 and the RRB Act. 1976 to provide sufficient banking and credit facility for agriculture and other rural sectors. These were set up on the recommendations of The M. Narasimham Working Group [1] during the tenure of Indira Gandhi's government with a view to include rural areas into economic mainstream since that time about 70% of the Indian Population was of Rural Orientation. The development process of RRBs started on 2 October 1975 with the forming of the first RRB, the Prathama Bank with authorised capital of Rs. 5 crore at its starting. Also on 2 October 1976 five regional rural banks were set up with a total authorised capital Rs. 100 crore ($10 Million) which later augmented to 500 crore ($50 Million). The Regional Rural Bank were owned by the Central Government, the State Government and the Sponsor Bank(There were five commercial banks, Punjab National Bank , State Bank of India , Syndicate Bank , United Bank of India and United Commercial Bank , which sponsored the regional rural banks) who held shares in the ratios as follows Central Government-50%, State Government- 15% and Sponsor Banks- 35 [2] %.. Earlier, Reserve Bank of India had laid down ceilings on the rate of interest to be charged by these RRBs. Recapitalization of Regional Rural Banks [ edit ] Subsequent to review of the financial status of RRBs by the Union Finance Minister in August, 2009, it was felt that a large number of RRBs had a low Capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR). A committee was therefore constituted in September, 2009 under the Chairmanship of K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor, RBI to analyse the financials of the RRBs and to suggest measures including re-capitalisation to bring the CRAR of RRBs to at least 9% in a sustainable manner by 2012. The Committee submitted its report in May, 2010. The following points were recommended by the committee: RRBs to have CRAR of at least 7% as of 31 March 2011 and at least 9% from 31 March 2012 onwards. recapitalisation requirement of Rs. 2,200.00 crore for 40 of the 82 RRBs. This amount is to be released in’ two installments in 2010-11 and 2011-12. . The remaining 42 RRBs will not require any capital and will be able to maintain CRAR of at least 9% ifs on 31 st March 2012 and thereafter on their own. A fund of Rs. 100 crore to be set up for training and capacity building of the RRB staff. The Government of India recently approved the recapitalization of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) to improve their Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio CRAR) in the following manner: Share of Central Government i.e. Rs.1, 100 crore will be released as per provisions made by the Department of Expenditure in 2010-11 and 2011-12. However, release of Government of India share will be contingent on proportionate release of State Government and Sponsor Bank share. A capacity building fund with a corpus of Rs.100 crore to be set up by Central Government with NABARD for training and capacity building of the RRB staff in the institution of NABARD and other reputed institutions. The functioning of the Fund will be periodically reviewed by the Central Government. An Action Plan will be prepared by NABARD in this regard and sent to Government for approval. Additional amount of Rs. 700 crore as contingency fund to meet the requirement of the weak RRBs, particularly those in the North Eastern. and Eastern Region, the necessary provision will be made in the Budget as and when the need arises. Organizational Structure [ edit ] The Organizational Structure for RRB's varies from branch to branch and depends upon the nature and size of business done by the branch. The Head Office of an RRB normally had three to seven departments. The following is the decision making hierarchy of officials in a Regional Rural Bank. Board of Directors Chairman & Managing Director General Manager Chief Manager/Regional Managers Senior Manager Manager Officer / Assist Amalgamation [ edit ] Currently, RRB's are going through a process of amalgamation and consolidation. 25 RRBs have been amalgamated in January 2013 into 10 RRBs. This counts 67 RRBs till the first week of June 2013. This counts 56 as of March 2015. On 31 March 2006, there were 133 RRBs (post-merger) covering 525 districts with a network of 14,494 branches. All RRBs were originally conceived as low cost institutions having a rural ethos, local feel and pro poor focus. However, within a very short time, most banks were making losses. The original assumptions as to the low cost nature of these institutions were belied. This may be again amalgamated in near future. At present there are 56 RRBs in India. Legal Existence and Protection [ edit ] RRB's are recognized by the law and they have legal significance.The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 Act No. 21 Of 1976 [9 February 1976.] reads ""For the incorporation, regulation and winding up of Regional Rural Banks with a view to developing the rural economy by providing, for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans and small entrepreneurs, and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto"".

(Photo: Esha Paul/ The Quint ) Note Ban | 6 min read Currency Ban Is Tearing Rural Banks Apart Aman Sethi November 17, 2016, 8:17 am On 8 November this year, the manager of a small semi-rural government bank branch in eastern Uttar Pradesh sat down for dinner in front of his television and found that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had destroyed his cash stock. “I froze when I heard that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes would be phased out in four hours,” he said, requesting anonymity to speak freely, “We had almost nothing in small notes.” His branch had a little over Rs 6 lakh in Rs 100 notes, another Rs 5.5 lakh in 20s, and about Rs 90,000 in Rs 10 notes, out of a total chest of over Rs 60 lakh. “We had no fifties,” he said ruefully, “and that was just the beginning.” (Photo: Rahul Gupta/ The Quint) India’s banking system has seized up under the strain of Prime Minister Modi’s decision to phase out high denomination banknotes with immediate effect. Its effects are most visible in rural India. The eventual benefits of demonetisation, economists say, are uncertain; but the costs are clear and visible. Also Read: Arrogance of the Rich Is Pushing Rural India to Embrace Note Ban A startling 81 percent of Indians in the countryside live in settlements without a brick and mortar bank, according to figures put out by the Reserve Bank of India; the corresponding number for urban India is zero. Unbanked areas, which account for 93 percent of rural India’s geographic expanse, are serviced by Rs 1.2 lakh “business correspondents”, young men like 30-year-old Dhruv Narayan Yadav who act as one-person bank counters in village markets and bazaars. Since 8 November, villagers desperate to exchange their defunct notes for valid currency have swamped the few functional banks and correspondents like Yadav, stretching an already strained system to breaking point. What follows is an account of two lives: one semi-rural bank branch manager, one young business correspondent, and their frantic efforts to stave off catastrophe even as the system intended to support them stuttered and failed. (Photo: Rahul Gupta/ The Quint ) On 9 November, the day after PM Modi’s announcement, banks across the country were closed to the public. The bank manager spent the day on the phone with his circle office, pleading for cash. Also Read: Before PM’s Announcement, Rumours of Demonetisation Abounded We asked for about Rs 25 lakh to service our approximately 40,000 account holders. Usually, during festive season, we have an average payout of Rs 40 lakh a day. Unbanked areas in India are served by “business correspondents”, essentially “human ATMs” operating out of small kiosks. (Photo: Esha Paul/ The Quint ) The next morning, as thousands queued up to exchange their money, the cash came in. “Our circle office had sent us Rs 4 lakh.” Staff were called back from leave, everyone including the bank manager manned the cash counters. Some customers got Rs 2,000, some got Rs 1,200, some got Rs 700. At 9 pm, when the branch finally closed, the cash counting machine packed up under the strain. “We stopped work and waited for a replacement.” The banker went home at 3:00 am. The next day, he asked for another Rs 25 lakh. “We got Rs 4 lakh.” By now, people were desperate. The wedding season was beginning – everyone needed cash. We informally told people, ‘come after banking hours with a copy of your marriage card as proof, we’ll try to give you Rs 5,000.’ What could we do? Bank Manager After a while, the banker felt bad asking his head office for more money, “Because we knew that every single rural bank was going through the same thing.” (Photo: Rahul Gupta/ The Quint) Dhruv Yadav, the SBI business correspondent (BC), was still in bed on 9 November when his bank manager called. As a correspondent in Badya Buzurg village, Yadav works like a human ATM machine: account holders can walk up to his small shop in the market and deposit up to Rs 20,000 a day with him or withdraw a similar amount. Yadav records the transactions on his computer and in the passbooks of his customers. “But now, we were told, you can take a deposit of only Rs 2,000 and you can give out only Rs 2,000. Also you can’t exchange any notes.” As he was leaving, the branch gave him some cash too, in case his customers in the village needed to withdraw money from their accounts. “They gave me a total of Rs 12,000,” he said, “I distributed the money between 25 people.” An SBI customer service centre in rural UP. (Photo: Esha Paul/ The Quint ) He asked people what they needed the money for. For instance, those buying vegetables got Rs 500, some got even less. “A woman came up to me and said, ‘my child has pneumonia’,” Yadav recalled, “If you don’t give me money, he’ll die.” The only person who got Rs 2,000, he said, was that mother. “I would have given her more, but I couldn’t break the rules.” Then he took her husband’s number and said he would call her when he got more money. A week passed; Yadav is still waiting for the money. In the meantime, 30 people across India died waiting to get hold of their own money. On 14 November, Finance Secretary Shaktikanta Das told the press, “there is absolutely no reason for the members of the public to feel any kind of panic” as there was enough cash in the banking system. Also Read: Banning Notes Was Easy, Now Comes The Hard Part Yet in Uttar Pradesh, the bank manager was making hard decisions. On 16 November, a week after demonetisation began, his branch finally got Rs 20 lakh. So they decided to give cash to 1,000 account holders. “It’s a trade-off,” he said, “Give lots of people some money, or less people more money.” The long working hours were putting a strain on his staff. The queue outside the bank would begin at 5 am, four hours before opening time. Customers were turning hostile, bank staff were so stressed they would occasionally erupt into shouting matches with each other. Some now had high blood pressure, others had low blood pressure. “Modi says the drive is also to reduce counterfeit currency,” he said, “but we are so short-staffed, we have no time to check each note. Cash is stacked into bundles, shoved into sacks and sealed.” (Photo: Rahul Gupta/ The Quint) What if a bundle of 1,000s turned out to be fake, the banker worried, would they force him to pay out of his savings? As the date of his retirement draws closer, the banker said he is increasingly reminded of a joke from the time Indira Gandhi nationalised the banks in 1969. “When the dogs would bark in the dead of night, people would say – go to sleep; it’s probably just a banker going home.” “It feels like we are back in those days again.” Download TheQuint App About Us Advertise With Us Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Powered by Quintype 2016 © Copyright TheQuint "

During this period, the bank has demonstrated its intent on embracing technology despite several constraints by introducing Rupay Debit Card facilities which were POS enabled recently, on-boarding on to NACH-Cr platform for DBTL implementation and SMS alert facility for debit & credit transactions. The bank has also taken the lead in the implementation of the Government’s PMJDY scheme in the state, opening the largest number of accounts and also issuing Rupay Debit-cum-ATM cards to PMJDY customers. The bank is looking forward to expand its alternate channel delivery systems with Internet Banking, mobile banking and IMPS services in the pipeline. We have also managed to keep in check NPA levels and maintain a healthy CRAR position as will be evident when the bank’s annual report for FY 2014-15 will be published in a few weeks time. I wish everyone continued success in the days to come and would also like to re-affirm the bank’s commitment to growth and development for state and country.

During this period, the bank has demonstrated its intent on embracing technology despite several constraints by introducing Rupay Debit Card facilities which were POS enabled recently, on-boarding on to NACH-Cr platform for DBTL implementation and SMS alert facility for debit & credit transactions. The bank has also taken the lead in the implementation of the Government’s PMJDY scheme in the state, opening the largest number of accounts and also issuing Rupay Debit-cum-ATM cards to PMJDY customers. The bank is looking forward to expand its alternate channel delivery systems with Internet Banking, mobile banking and IMPS services in the pipeline. We have also managed to keep in check NPA levels and maintain a healthy CRAR position as will be evident when the bank’s annual report for FY 2014-15 will be published in a few weeks time. I wish everyone continued success in the days to come and would also like to re-affirm the bank’s commitment to growth and development for state and country. << Start < Prev 1 2 Next > End >> Page 1 of 2 Disclaimer The contents of this Web Site are for general information only.

Finance Ministry sources told BTVi the proposed Gyan Sangam-like event, to be anchored by NABARD and finance ministry, will involve all the 56 RRBs will have representation in the event. The Finance Ministry is working on broad themes for the first event, said an official privy to the development. ""The focus will be on financial inclusion and RRB infrastructure."" On broad themes, another official said: ""The government is working on the themes for the upcoming event. But what we need to understand is that the RRBs are the original microfinance institutions."" ""And since we want to take the agenda of financial inclusion to the next level, we need to leverage the network of 18,000 RRBs spread across the country,"" he added. Use of the RRB network to widen the reach of Mudra Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana is also on the agenda of the government. The Modi government had a resounding success of the Aadhaar and Jan Dhan Yojana in spreading financial inclusion. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday showcased the success of Aadhaar and Jan Dhan Yojana for the spread of financial inclusion and helping the poor at the IMF-World Bank annual meeting. In his keynote address at the Annual Meeting Flagship event organized by the World Bank on the issue of ‘Financial Inclusion and De-risking’, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said various steps like leveraging digital IDs (Aadhaar), expanding access networks (PM Jan-Dhan Yojana) and digitizing financial benefit transfers (including Insurance and Pension schemes) taken by the Government of India have led to the tremendous progress towards achievement of the universal financial inclusion goal during the last couple of years. As per latest data of UIDAI, Aadhaar cards have issued to 106.48 crore Indians covering more than 86 pent of the population. The success of Aadhaar could be judged by the fact that close to 300 crore transactions were authenticated via Aadhaar. The government has been providing subsidies to the poor through the Aadhaar-linked bank accounts. On the other hand, Jan Dhan Yojana has brought in 24.74 crore poor into the banking network and Rs 43,500 crore were deposited in these no-frill bank accounts which also offers life insurance, health insurance and pension products at cheaper costs. India has 56 RRBs spread across the nation. The RRBs supplement commercial banks in extending credit in rural areas. Until March 2006, there were 133 RRBs covering 525 districts with a network of 14,494 branches. However, the RRB's are going through a process of amalgamation and consolidation and 25 RRBs have been amalgamated in January 2013 into 10 RRBs. The government had also initiated a restructuring exercise to shore up the capital adequacy ratio of RRBs to 9 per cent to align them with other banks and strengthen their financial health.

Today's Classroom 16 Apr 2016 by Tojo Jose What are Regional Rural Banks? What are the reform introduced for RRBs? Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were set up as government-sponsored, regional based rural lending institutions under the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976. RRBs were configured as hybrid micro banking institutions, combining the local orientation and small scale lending culture of the cooperatives and the business culture of commercial banks. Their mission was to fulfill the credit needs of the relatively unserved sections in the rural areas -small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers and socio-economically weaker sections. Shareholding pattern of RRBs among the three sponsoring entities is 50:35:15 among central government, sponsoring bank and state government respectively. Recapitalization and amalgamation of RRBs RRBs became financially weak with many having high NPAs because of the difficult loans they are giving. A committee chaired by Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty reviewed the financial position of all RRBs in 2010 and recommended for recapitalization of 40 out of 82 RRBs. According to the Committee, the remaining RRBs are in a position to achieve the desired level of CRAR on their own. Accepting the recommendations of the committee, the central government along with other shareholders started to recapitalize eh RRBs by injecting funds into them. In the same manner the process of amalgamation continued. Amalgamation of RRBs were made in two phases and the number of RRBs were brought down during the first phase significantly. In the second phase of amalgamation and restructuring, which is ongoing from 2012, geographically extensive RRBs within a State under different sponsor banks are amalgamated to have just one RRB in medium-sized states and two or three RRBs in large states. Amalgamation of RRBs into sponsoring banks and their merger brought down the number from 196 in late 1990s to 56 by 2016. Most of the reform measures enabled the RRBs to make a smart recovery without being a burden and at the same time keeping their original risky mission of extending lending to the rural people. But still their NPAs remains high at around 6% (gross) and in the future also their activities need additional capital in the context of advanced capital requirements and regulatory standards. Hence, to enable them to acquire more capital the government has enacted RRB Amendment Act (2015). The amendment is aimed to help them to mobilize resource from financial markets. This Act let them to mobilize additional capital by keeping a combined government holding of at least 51%. RRBs Amendment Act 2015 The Regional Rural Banks (Amendment) Act, 2015, came into effect from 4 th February 2016. The Act raises the amount of authorised capital to Rs 2,000 crore and states that it cannot be reduced below Rs One crore. The Act allows RRBs to raise capital from sources other than the existing shareholders -central and state governments, and sponsor banks. Here, the combined shareholding of the central government and the sponsor bank cannot be less than 51%. For the sponsoring banks, they can provide various initiating assistance to the RRBs beyond the initial five years (previously, the sponsoring bank’s responsibility will be over in five years). The Act states that the central government may by notification raise or reduce the limit of shareholding of the central government, state government or the sponsoring bank in the RRB. For this, the central government may consult the state government and the sponsor bank. ********* Today's Classroom Topic What are the long-term benefits of demonetization?

They have been set-up with the basic objective of providing credit facilities to the rural population, who had very limited access to the formal credit system. The area of operation of RRBs is confined to what Government of India had notified, to include one or many districts in a State. The RRBs came into existence to facilitate the poor section of people, called as the ""Target Group"". In 1975, during the regime of former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, the Narasimham Working Group recommended to set up RRBs, as the major portion of the society – about 70% – in India comprised of rural areas. The RRBs are owned by the Governments at the center and the states and the Sponsor Banks. Branch Expansion The Government initiated to open more branches in rural unbanked areas. In the year 2001-02, banks were also allowed to transform their branches which were incurring losses into mobile / satellite offices. This was permitted only if did not affect their performance in the service areas. Deposit Mobilization Deposit mobilization is an important banking variable determining the path of growth of a financial institution. It depends upon the saving capacity and saving habit of the people in the area in which the bank is operating. Another factor determining the size of deposits is the rate of interest. If the rate of interest is high, the number of deposit accounts would be more. Deposits mobilized by the RRBs play a key role not only as an important source of funds but also as an instrument for promoting savings and banking habits among the rural people. Credit Deployment Credit deployment is another essential component of growth for any banking institution. This is important to those banking institutions which have been established to meet the credit requirements of untapped sector in the country. RRBs grant direct advances in the form of crop loans, agricultural loans, loans for allied activities, loans for rural artisans, village and cottage industries, self-employed persons and consumption loans. RRBs also make indirect advances which are routed through agencies such as Farmers' Service Societies, Farmers' Clubs, Primary Agricultural Societies, Self-Help Groups, etc. Growth of RRBs RRBs proved instrumental in achieving the target of inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The number of RRBs' branches have increased to 16,170 during 2011-12 from 14,468 during 2000-01 i.e. an increase of 1.1 times. The number of districts covered also increased to 620 during 2011-12 from 482 during 2000-01 i.e. an increase of 1.3 times. The linear and compound growth rates of it account for 0.212% and 0.208% which indicates an insignificant growth of bank branches of Regional Rural Banks in India. However, there is a 65% increase in the Credit-Deposit ratio during the same period, which indicates the willingness of Target Group to invest in RRBs. Conclusion Although the growth rate of RRBs is very low, the Deposits and Credits are significantly high. Credit-Deposit ratio has increased over the period of time, leading to sufficient mobilization of funds in the regional areas.

Photo: Bloomberg So far, the bank branch has been the nerve centre of the government’s demonetization drive. Branches in metro areas are struggling to cope with demand. For customers banking on branches in rural areas, it could be worse. About 93% of the 595,000-odd rural areas remain ‘unbanked’—they have no physical branch ( see chart 1 ). And there are 629 million Indians, or about 81% of population in rural areas, residing in these 554,000-odd unbanked centres ( see chart 2 ). This unbanked number should be tempered by two new supply channels. The first is the 125,000 ‘bank mitras’—bank agents assigned to a fixed unbanked area under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana. The second is the 531,000 roving banking correspondents in rural areas, whose coverage details are unavailable. Both these sets, and the post office, need to come into play in rural areas. If they don’t, the yawning gap in branch coverage between rural areas and other areas (see chart 4) can greatly inconvenience rural Indians in this period of transition. howindialives.com is a database and search engine for public data Click here for enlarge HowIndiaLives Topics: cash withdrawals currency exchange rural banks bank branches ATMs READ MORE Editor's Picks How the Tamil Nadu economy fared under Jayalalithaa Rs2,000 crore of undisclosed income revealed after demonetisation: Tax dept Narendra Modi’s great leap forward First Published: Wed, Nov 16 2016. 04 29 AM IST More from Livemint Jayalalithaa’s funeral: Key highlights Airtel names Raghunath Mandava as chief of Africa operations Laurus Labs IPO subscribed 28% on Day 1 Latest News Airtel names Raghunath Mandava as chief of Africa operations Laurus Labs IPO subscribed 28% on Day 1 Narendra Modi’s note ban decision has made people ‘fakir’: Mayawati Sushma Swaraj’s kidney transplant likely this weekend Face-recognition start-up Megvii said to raise $100 million Mint On Sunday My grandmother’s Kashmiri dream The best of Kirk Douglas From haldi doodh to turmeric latte: Indian food wisdom comes full circle What’s ailing UPI and how to fix it Idea junkies and cocaine addicts Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

Accordingly, the comprehensive revised guidelines on Priority Sector Lending – Targets and Classification for Regional Rural Banks are enclosed as Annex. The revised guidelines supersede all earlier guidelines mentioned in the Master Circular RPCD.CO.RRB.BC 5/03.05.33/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014 on Regional Rural Banks - Lending to Priority Sector.

The Bank's shares are subscribed to by the Government of India, State Bank of India, and Government of Meghalaya in the ratio 50:35:15. Meghalaya Rural Bank has the mandate of the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 to extend credit and other banking facilities for development of the rural areas of the State of Meghalaya. The Bank began operations under the nomenclature of Ka Bank Nongkyndong Ri Khasi Jaintia on 29th December 1981 with the opening of its first branch in Shillong. Since that beginning, there has been no looking back. Today the total business of the Bank is in excess of Rs 1250 crore and its network of 67 fully CBS-compliant branches (as on 31st December 2012) is the second largest among all banks operating in Meghalaya - second, that is, only to State Bank of India - the Bank's sponsor. Meghalaya Rural Bank currently stands as a major provider of priority sector credit in the State. It disburses crop loans to small and marginal farmers and nurtures self-help groups (SHGs), joint liability group (JLGs), and Farmers' Clubs. The Bank provides utmost support to the implementation of government-­sponsored schemes such as the Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) and Swarna-jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY), and affords generous finance to education, transportation, housing, and small and medium industries and businesses. Meghalaya Rural Bank is keenly aware of its responsibility to promote Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy among the rural folk and all of its branches have been primed to extend basic but effective and sound banking facilities to each and every household found in the command area of respective branches. The Bank is in process of increasing its number of full-fledged branches as well Banking Correspondents (BCs) so that all strategic centres of the State might be covered effectively. The Bank's clientele is comprised of rural as well as urban dwellers, the masses as well as classes. Its customers range from humble subsistence cultivators, to aspiring students, entrepreneurs, small shopkeepers, and high-end businessmen. The Bank has the mission of linking one rural part to another rural part and to connect the rural to the urban. In a word, the vision of Meghalaya Rural Bank is to be the preferred banker for all of Meghalaya. The speciality of Meghalaya Rural Bank lies in its emphasis on building relationships. The Bank aspires to know its customers as friends and to retain them not only for a short while but for a lifetime. It understands that it is only by such means that the Bank might come to know its clients well and be in a position to anticipate and fulfill their needs for various banking and related financial services. Meghalaya Rural Bank, by virtue of its ownership pattern, is uniquely placed to draw upon the strength of the Government of India, the focus of the Government of Meghalaya, and the vast expertise and heritage of State Bank of India. The Bank's work force of over 300 strong is comprised of a fine mix of youth and energy, talent and experience. A large portion of the work force is female, and most of the employees belong to the indigenous scheduled tribes of the State. Meghalaya Rural Bank is profit-making and one of the best performing and premier RRBs of the country. 'Think global-act local' is an important maxim with the Bank.

45,"6 Major Problems faced by Regional Rural Banks of India YourArticleLibrary.com: The Next Generation Library Your Article Library Home Share Your Files Disclaimer Privacy Policy Contact Us Content Guidelines Prohibited Content Image Guidelines Plagiarism Prevention Content Filtrations Terms of Service Account Disabled 6 Major Problems faced by Regional Rural Banks of India Article shared by Six major problems faced by regional rural banks are as follows: 1. Haste and Lack of Co-ordination in Branch Expansion 2. Difficulties in Deposit Mobilisation 3. Constraints in Deposit Mobilisation 4. Slow Progress in Lending Activity 5. Urban-Orientation of Staff 6. Procedural Rigidities. The RRBs, in most cases, seemingly have a mixed record of ‘successes’ on some fronts and ‘failures’ on some others in their business and attainment of goals. ADVERTISEMENTS: Their failure in achieving their targets may be attributed to several problems they encounter in practice. Following Professor Charan Wadhva, we may pinpoint some of the major problems faced by the RRBs as under. 1. Haste and Lack of Co-ordination in Branch Expansion: Haste in branch expansion programme in many cases has resulted in lopsidedness due to lack of co-ordination. In several cases, it could not be ensured that the branches of the RRBs are opened at centres where no commercial or co-operative banking facilities were provided. 2. Difficulties in Deposit Mobilisation: The RRBs encountered a number of practical difficulties in deposit mobilisation. On account of their restrictive lending policy which excludes richer sections of the village society, these potential depositors show least interest in depositing their money with these banks. 3. Constraints in Deposit Mobilisation: The RRBs exclude the richer sections of the village society in providing direct financial assistance. These sections have potential savings to deposit. But, they are least interested in depositing them with the RRBs in view of the restrictive credit policy of these banks. Further, state and local governments and their agencies also have not co-operated much by maintaining their deposit accounts with the RRBs. In short, the RRBs have failed to mobilise accounts within themselves. 4. Slow Progress in Lending Activity : The RRBs’ pace of growth in loan business is slow. For this the following reasons may be given: (i) There have been limited scope for direct lending by RRBs in their fields of operations; (ii) It is always difficult to identify the potential small borrowers and the bank staff have been required to make special and sincere efforts in this regard; (iii) Most of the small borrowers do not like the bank formalities and prefer to borrow from the informal/indigenous sources of finance, such as money­lenders; (iv) The anomalies in the Differential Interest Rate (DIR) Scheme also posed a special problem to the RRBs. While the RRBs charge 14 per cent interest, the commercial banks charge only 4 per cent under the DIR Scheme in rural areas. ADVERTISEMENTS: Thus, no borrower would go to RRBs or co-operative societies in the area when a loan from the commercial bank is available under the DIR Scheme; (v) There is no effective link between the RRBs and PACS and the farmers’ service societies; (vi) There is lack of co-ordination between officials of the district credit planning committees and the RRBs. 5. Urban-Orientation of Staff: A crucial practical difficulty experienced in their working by the RRBs is the urban orientation of their staff which is rarely inclined to serve in rural areas. There is no true local involvement of the bank staff in the village where they serve. 6. Procedural Rigidities: The RRBs follow the procedures of the scheduled commercial banks in the matter of deposits and advancing loans which are highly complicated and time-consuming from the villagers’ point of view. The rural borrowers always appreciate informal ways and simple procedures as have been followed by the money-lenders and the indigenous bankers. ADVERTISEMENTS: Concluding Remarks : Despite these problems, the RRBs have been trying their level best to achieve their social objectives. They have succeeded in projecting their image of ‘small man’s bank’. They are, in fact, development banks of the rural poor. They have been trying to fill regional and functional gaps in rural finance in our country.
