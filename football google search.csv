Today’s tittle-tattle is not that desperate Will Mesut Özil pack up his snood and head to Manchester? Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Getty Images Jacob Steinberg @JacobSteinberg Friday 11 November 2016 08.58 GMT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 09.00 GMT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger A fter a slow news week, what the world really needs now is the prospect of a war of words between Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho. It’s been too long since the last time we were treated to one. Not to worry, though, because Manchester United have been alerted to Mesut Özil ’s hesitation to sign a new Arsenal contract. Having decided that he can’t be bothered trying to remember how to spell Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s name when he writes his team sheets, Mourinho wants a reunion with Özil. Wenger will presumably do the gentlemanly thing and stand aside. Mourinho saw Özil first, remember, so fair’s fair. Maybe not. But Özil’s contract isn’t the only thing on Wenger’s mind. The Arsenal manager also has to deal with interest from Milan and Napoli in Olivier Giroud , who has grown frustrated with his lack of playing time this season. The French striker could be set to take his maddening mix of inspiration and buffoonery to Italy in January, unless Wenger can persuade him to stay put on Arsenal’s bench. Why are Benfica refusing to pay a small Swedish club €250,000? Read more Cesc Fàbregas is looking for a January move, but the Chelsea midfielder’s hopes of a return to Spain are looking slim. The Sevilla manager Jorge Sampaoli is a noted admirer of Fabregas, it says here. But not so much that he actually wants to sign him. On his way to Spain, however, is Glen Johnson . Understandably, you think the Mill is about to reveal that the Stoke right-back is a target for Levante, Eibar or Celta Vigo. Nope. How desperate are Barcelona for a new right-back? This desperate. Mind you, not that desperate. The La Liga giants have no intention of scuppering Trabzonspor ’s swoop for Aston Villa outcast Micah Richards . Everton want Memphis “Memphis” Depay on loan. And in disappointing news for Liverpool, Christian Pulisic is set to sign a new contract at Borussia Dortmund. Perhaps Wenger can get him to show Özil how to scrawl his signature on a piece of paper.

Coach Tite and Brazil make it five straight wins and Argentina continue dwelling in their own downfall. There was nothing about this match that should suggest they can do anything against Colombia next week, even if they are at home. The entire Brazilian squad - energized and inspired by Carlos Alberto as he looked down from heaven - delivered a performance that would make the legends of the 70’s extremely proud. Before this match, the last time Brazil played in Belo Horizonte, Germany had embarrassed them 7-1 at the World Cup in 2014. Now, they have a new memory. Edgardo Bauza, meanwhile, has a lot to think about. Was Higuaín really the best choice to start? Where is the relentless pressure or the grit and desire we are so accustomed to seeing when we watch Albiceleste? Answers better come fast because a hungry Colombia is coming to town. Thanks for tuning in and I’ll see you next time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.38am GMT 01:38 End of match 90 min+2: That’s it. Brazil win convincingly. A masterful victory. Updated at 1.39am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.37am GMT 01:37 89 min: A great ball wide to Neymar, who finds Costa, but Argentina just about clear it from the box. Messi, who hasn’t touched the ball in a while, can only admire at his Barca teammate and the way he leads the Selecao. Neymar really is a sight to behold when he leads his nation. Messi finally gets the ball and dribbles towards the box but deflects wide. Updated at 1.38am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.32am GMT 01:32 84 min: Firmino hits the post after a great cross....Coutinho comes out for Douglas Costa - a great performance from the Liverpool man. Firmino again enters the box but Otamendi just about clears it. This is truly shambolic by Argentina and ironically enough, they could really benefit from another Argentinian manager who instills a lot of grit and energy...Ricardo Gareca. But he’s busy managing Peru. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.28am GMT 01:28 81 min: Firmino replaces Gabriel Jesus. Manchester City fans are going to be spoiled with the things he does, a great No 9....and he’s only 19. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.26am GMT 01:26 79 min: Wow, Neymar close to making 4-0 as he breaks through the center and into the box but his second touch is too heavy and the ball goes out. Brazil chanting Ole now, and it’s going to be a long flight back to Buenos Aires. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.21am GMT 01:21 75 min: There are shades of the old Brazil here, with lovely one-touch football. I actually can’t remember the last time Messi touched the ball or even made a significant contribution. Albiceleste look to penetrate Brazil’s box but a stout defense takes it right back. Updated at 1.22am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.18am GMT 01:18 69 min: Aguero gets fouled just outside the box but nothing materializes. There are 20 minutes left and there is nothing about this match that says Argentina will get a goal, let alone come back. Brazil look composed and really loving their football. Di Maria looks exhausted and needs to be subbed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.13am GMT 01:13 65 min: Neymar and Brazil are just having too much fun right now and Higuaín doesn’t like it as he fouls the Barca man. Argentina are losing the match and their heads on the process. Brazil in complete domination. In other news, Peru is currently beating Paraguay 4-1 in Asunción. First away win since 2004. I might explode after I’m done here....just warning you. Updated at 1.14am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.06am GMT 01:06 Goal! Brazil 3-0 Argentina (Paulinho 59) 59 min: Well, this time around, Paulinho doesn’t miss and makes it game over as he capitalizes on a cross from the right hand side. This is huge. Argentina are losing 3-0, currently out of the top 5...next match is gigantic. Updated at 1.07am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.03am GMT 01:03 57 min: Wow, this game should be over. Gabriel Jesus once again finds Paulinho who rounds the keeper...all he needs to do is score and its over but Zabaleta saves it on the line! Neymar gets fouled by Funes Mori. Freekick to Brazil , a great attempt by Dani Alves but its saved by Romero. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.59am GMT 00:59 53 min: Neymar fouls Funes Mori and once again, Tite has to warn his players to calm down. Brazil have taken on the high-press approach, knowing that Argentina is rattled. Messi finds Aguero but it’s offside. This is Bauza’s biggest issue...not being able to figure out how to encourage rapid movement inside the box. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.55am GMT 00:55 49 min: Brazil start the second the same way they ended the first, with relentless counterattacking. Aguero, who replaced Perez, draws a yellow card as Marcelo can’t stop him on the right hand side. Another Messi-taken free-kick, this time a good ball in, but can’t be met by anyone.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.35am GMT 00:35 Half-time Well, it’s clearly cruise control for Brazil right now as Argentina are getting rocked by the counter. It’s all going badly for Bauza’s team. I’m sure Aguero will come in the second half straight away. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.34am GMT 00:34 Goal! Brazil 2-0 Argentina (Neymar 45) 45 min: What a great pass by Gabriel Jesus, who cuts through the Argentinian defense and feeds Neymar who calmly puts it in corner. Wow. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.30am GMT 00:30 42 min: What a great cross by Más from the left hand side, and it just can’t be met by Higuaín who was too slow to react. Argentina are finishing this half strongly with all the action in Brazil’s half...they just can’t find the back of the net.

At times you would think that is the case but it’s due to the fact that Alves and Marcelo push so high up when in possession. I agree with you - a special goal. Question. Is my TV playing tricks on me or are Brazil playing a 2-4-1-3? John Fearon via email Updated at 12.27am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.25am GMT 00:25 37 min: Another free-kick for Argentina as Messi gets fouled outside the box. This is an almost perfect angle for la Pulga but he drives it against the wall. If it carries on like this, it won’t be long until we see Aguero. On the counter, Neymar takes it all the way into the box from the right hand side, but instead of delivering a low cross, he shoots it himself and hits the post. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.22am GMT 00:22 33 min: As Argentina decide to press, Brazil stick to the same plan by sitting until opposition enter their half. Perez drives towards the box and shoots from just outside but it goes wide. Higuaín struggling to stay onside - a problem when you play lone striker. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.18am GMT 00:18 29 min: That goal certainly shook Argentina , who up to that point, were clearly the better team in terms of possession. Bauza has now instructed his team to press higher up the field as plan A has disintegrated.

Brazil 1-0 Argentina (Coutinho 25) 25 min: What a goal by Coutinho! The Liverpool man cuts in from the left hand side and drives towards the box and curls it past the keeper. This boy is on fire! Updated at 12.14am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.12am GMT 00:12 24 min: The first real chance by Argentina falls to Biglia with a great shot from outside of the box and it took a great save from Alisson to stop it! Messi worked so well on the right hand side to find the Lazio man and he took a powerful shot that was well met by the keeper. The best chance of the match. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.08am GMT 00:08 20 min: The crowd chant every time Neymar touches the ball but aside from that nothing much in terms of real chances. An extremely nervy first 20 minutes from both sides. Updated at 12.09am GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.06am GMT 00:06 Thank you for the email, Julian. Of course, no problem. Hey... I live in a country (China) where Twitter is banned. Any chance line ups can be written instead of linked to? Many thanks, Julian Brazil - Alisson, Alves, Miranda, Marqui, Marcelo, Paulinho, Fernandinho, Renato; Coutinho, Jesus, Neymar. Argentina - Romero; Zabaleta, Otamendi, Mori, Más, Pérez, Biglia, Mascherano, Di María; Messi, Higuaín. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.03am GMT 00:03 16 min: Coutinho is playing extremely wide right now, with Gabriel Jesus playing as the lone striker. This is where the Liverpool man can usually show signs of fading for Brazil as he is best suited to play directly behind the striker in an almost-free role. Still nothing in terms of a real chance. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.00am GMT 00:00 12 min: Neymar beginning to show some trickery but can’t pass Mascherano who basically falls to the ground to try and stop the Brazilian’s dribbling. Albiceleste dominating in possession now, looking to stay in the final third and actually looking to press slightly higher, hoping to push Brazil back to their own box. Di Maria hasn’t even touched the ball, until now...all the action has been on the right hand side. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.55pm GMT 23:55 8 min: Tite has instructed his team to not press until the opposition enter their half, then counter. Fernandinho gets a yellow as he elbows Messi, who had embarrassed him with a nice ball above his head. Things calm down after that and Argentina push more - better from Bauza’s men. Brazil need to be careful with being over physical. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.51pm GMT 23:51 4 min: Brazil begin the first few minutes with quick possession and Argentina hold, taking on their defensive shape, waiting to counter. It’s clear Higuaín will spearhead the frontline with Messi playing right behind him, free to move from left to right. Messi gets fouled about 35 yards outside of the box and takes a free-kick which goes nowhere. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.47pm GMT 23:47 Kick-off 1 min: Peep! And we’re off! Argentina kick-off. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.44pm GMT 23:44 The squads walk out to the stadium and the atmosphere is electric as the FIFA anthem plays in the background. Dani Alves, by the way, wearing the No 4 shirt, in honor of the legendary Carlos Alberto, who passed away last month. Now the anthems are playing and first it’s Argentina followed by Brazil, which is obviously met with thunderous chants. I don’t think I have ever seen Neymar or Messi so focused. There’s a moment of silence for Carlos Alberto. Next time you hear from me will be kick-off. Updated at 11.46pm GMT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.37pm GMT 23:37 The stage is set and players are inside the tunnel ready to come out.

Some results from earlier: Colombia 0-0 Chile Uruguay is currently leading against Ecuador 1-0 and Paraguay and Peru have just started. Bolivia faces Venezuela at 7pm ET. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.29pm GMT 20:29 Preamble Hello everyone and welcome to the Superclásico of South America as Brazil host Argentina in a crucial World Cup qualifier. For theses Conmebol nations, the road to Russia 2018 has been nothing short of thrilling as only six points separate the top seven teams in the table. Brazil , thanks to Tite, are loving life right now as the 55-year-old manager has introduced a calmer, happier Selecao, free to express individual talent as well as cohesive teamwork. The result? Four consecutive victories and top of the table. Argentina on the other hand are heading in the wrong direction and things need to change quickly. Edgardo Bauza has not started well and things went from bad to worse when Conmebol allotted three points to Chile and Peru as a result of Bolivia’s use of an ineligible player when they played against them. Consequently, Chile leap-frogged Argentina and currently hold the final qualifying spot. The pressure is on Argentina to get something out of this match as they really can’t afford to drop any more points. Brazil, meanwhile, hope this ride keeps on going. Here is Argentina’s line-up: Selección Argentina (@Argentina) #Eliminatorias ¡Confirmado por Edgardo Bauza!

Media playback is not supported on this device Poppy row needless argument for FA - Mills England are playing Scotland at Wembley for the first time since August 2013 World Cup qualifying Group F: England v Scotland Venue : Wembley Stadium Date : Friday, 11 November Kick-off : 19:45 GMT Coverage : Listen on BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Radio Scotland & BBC Sport app; live text commentary on BBC Sport website & app Fifa says it has not banned the display of poppies by England and Scotland footballers, insisting any such claim is a ""distortion of the facts"". Both countries asked to wear black armbands bearing a poppy in Friday's World Cup qualifier on Armistice Day. Rules forbid ""political"" statements on shirts and Fifa says it does not have the power to grant such requests. However, former player Danny Mills says the English FA has ""picked the wrong fight"" over the issue. What about the other Home Nations? Northern Ireland - who host Azerbaijan in Belfast on Friday - will wear plain black armbands, as will Wales when they play Serbia on Saturday. Fifa says it has reminded the four football associations of the rules - though the Football Association of Wales (FAW) said Fifa ""turned down a request for the Wales national team to wear poppies on their shirts or on armbands"". The FAW said it could not risk a financial penalty or point deduction and fans at Cardiff City Stadium will form a poppy mosaic before kick-off. Northern Ireland's game will see a card motif featuring a poppy displayed in the West Stand along with other Armistice Day tributes. England Under-21s wore poppies on black armbands during their win over Italy on Thursday night. What is Fifa's stance? Football's rules are laid out by the International Football Association Board - which is made up of the four British FAs and Fifa. Any breach of the rules is dealt with by Fifa's disciplinary committee - which Fifa says is an independent body. It added it could not pre-judge what symbols would constitute a breach of rules. Fifa said that when contacted by the four FAs about wearing poppy symbols, it ""reminded them about law four"" - which states players are not allowed to wear ""political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images"". The sport's governing says it ""reiterated"" to the FAs that ""only the independent disciplinary committee can decide"" if the rules have been broken and what sanction should apply. ""The perception that Fifa 'banned' anything is a distortion of the facts,"" it added. Fifa's secretary general, Fatma Samoura, told BBC Sport last week: ""We have to apply uniformly and across the 211 member associations the laws of the game. ""Britain is not the only country that has been suffering from the result of war. The only question is why are we doing exceptions for just one country and not the rest of the world?"" England v Scotland fixture 'known all over the world' Pick your best modern-day combined XI Stepping out of the shadows: Name the England and Scotland players Scotland's Wembley heroes and villains Spain's Costa to miss England friendly FA has picked wrong fight - Mills Former England defender Mills has questioned the English FA's stance on the poppy issue. ""I think the FA has picked the wrong fight,"" Mills told BBC Breakfast. ""It is likely to get a fine because of this. ""Surely all of the money that has been spent on arguments, lawyers and the fine it may get from Fifa would have been much better being donated to the Royal British Legion. It would have done far more good than this needless argument. Media playback is not supported on this device Poppy row needless argument for FA - Mills ""It's commercialised the poppy more than anything else. This is supposed to be a quiet remembrance, 11 o'clock, two-minutes silence remembering those that gave their lives, were injured and gave up so much for our freedom, for our freedom of speech."" Will possible sanctions hurt the teams? The English FA's revenues are expected to increase by 35% to £420m in 2018 and England are top of their qualifying group with seven points after three games, with Scotland fourth on four points. Northern Ireland are third in their group, five points behind leaders Germany and three adrift of second-placed Azerbaijan. Wales are third in Group D with five points, two behind Serbia and the Republic of Ireland. Only the top team qualifies automatically for the World Cup in Russia, with the second-placed side possibly entering a play-off. English FA chief executive Martin Glenn has said it will contest any fine. ""Fifa have much bigger problems they should be concentrating on,"" he said. ""I'm confident our legal position is right and our moral position is right. Our case is absolutely rock solid."" What are the views of managers and players? Interim England manager Gareth Southgate described the poppy on Thursday as ""part of our identity as a nation"". ""We're just pleased that we can honour the sacrifice of those who have gone before us,"" he added. Scotland captain Darren Fletcher said: ""First and foremost, I think everyone would love to wear the poppy and wants to wear the poppy to show our respect. ""Fifa have their rules and you understand why, but hopefully common sense prevails."" Wales boss Chris Coleman has backed the stance of the FAW. ""Remembrance Day is today [Friday] and we'll show respect in the right manner. Criticism will come but we don't listen to that,"" said Coleman. What could happen next? The first stage in any disciplinary process that might follow Friday's game would be for Fifa's match commissioner at Wembley to include the armbands in the official report. The case would then go to the disciplinary committee, which would announce its decision a few weeks later. A points deduction is the most serious sanction available but a fine is considered to be more likely. The British FAs would then have an opportunity to challenge that fine via Fifa's appeals process and a further chance to appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, a course of action that would probably cost more than the fine.

28," The Beautiful Game Of Football - Inside The CBC Home Subscribe Business Sports About Contact Privacy Policy The Beautiful Game Of Football Author: Doyle Lymon August 29, 2016 0 Comments Sports Football is played by about 240 million people around the world according to the statistics taken out by FIFA in the year 2001 and that was 15 years ago, imagine by how much the numbers must have increased now specially after the popularity of the 2010 World Cup. Football has been played since a long time, they might not exactly be football but they were different forms but any sport that had to do with a ball being controlled by a leg has been connected to football. For example the Chinese played a game where they had put a ball through a goal using their hands and legs and so did the old Greeks but the game played by the Greeks can hardly be compared to football as it was a way more violent form of football and was more of a mixture of wrestling and football and has more resemblance to the Rugby format. The modern football rules were formulated in the Cambridge University matches and we saw the rise of football in the public schools of England in the 1800’s. Later on the Sheffield FA played football with their own set of rules and these were later absorbed in to FA to form their own rules. Later, the FA trophy was created with 11 teams and this is the oldest running football tournament in the world RULES Football is generally played on a rectangular field between two squads for 90 minutes and each squad comprises of 11 players, including a goalkeeper. There are two goals on each side of field of equal size and it is the responsibility of the goalkeeper to block a goal while another team tries to score in the goal. The game is played for 90 minutes in two halves and whichever team has scored the most goals in that time frame, wins the game. If the score is the same then the game is continued into extra time or any other formats like penalty shootouts, golden goal, etc. You can touch the ball with any part of your body other than your arm, only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch ball with his arms inside his own half. There are four match officials who are used in a game and they are responsible to check if the game is being played fairly or not. One is the referee and he roams around the field checking every movement of players around the ball and they have the right to issue warnings to players in the form of yellow card or even ask a player to leave the field by dismissing him using a red card. A referee’s decision is final and is unquestionable. There are two linesmen on two sides of the field and they are the judge of throw ins and offsides. There is also a fourth official who keeps the benches of the two teams in check and officiates substituitions. The referee is also the official time keeper of the game and can add extra time at the end of halves due to stoppage of play during the normal time due to injuries and substituitions. There are many terms in football that you need to be sure of before you get into the game. Fouls are conceded when a player from an opponent team tackles another player without touching the ball and there is only contact between the legs and other parts of the body. Depending on the intensity of the foul committed. The referee might just give a warning or even show a yellow card or sometimes a direct dismissal with the use of the red card. If the ball goes out of the field then it is brought in by the team using their hand or legs. Hands are used in thrown ins along the length of the field and feet are used in corner kicks along the width of the pitch. If games are stopped in the game due to an injury or any other convenience then the game is started with a drop of the ball or an indirect free kick. If a foul is committed by a team then the game is restarted with a direct free kick against the team. In an indirect free kick you can’t score directly from the spot whereas in a direct free kick you can score a goal directly from the spot. The last important term to understand is the offside. An offside is committed when a player of a squad is beyond the line of the opposition’s defence line or if the player is beyond the opposition’s last defender when the pass is played to him. Then it is called offside and the other team gets a free kick. GOVERNING BODIES There are many organizations that control the footballing entities and every continent has their own governing bodies. FIFA is the largest governing body that control all the other bodies from the various continents. They have their headquarters at Zurich and Gianni Infantino is the current president. They were created in 1904 and are responsible for hosting various tournaments like the FIFA World Cup, FIFA world Club Cup, the Confederations Cup and other fusbal and beach football tournaments. FIFA has total revenue of 1.3 billion USD every year and generate a net profit of 700 million USD. They are responsible for giving away awards like the Ballon’D Or and other awards for various feats during a season. They keep official records of all the matches around the globe and are also seeing to development of new technologies so that they can make the game completely fair. During the 2014 World Cup they used goal line technology so that they get more precise results and the technology has been received with positive reviews.

30," Football - Wikipedia Football From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about the overall concept of games called football. For specific versions of the game, the balls themselves and other uses of the term, see Football (disambiguation) . Several codes of football. Images, from top down, left to right: association football , Australian rules football , international rules football , a rugby union scrum, rugby league , and American football . Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal . Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called 'football' in certain places include: association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football ); Australian rules football ; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union ); and Gaelic football . [1] [2] These different variations of football are known as football codes . Various forms of football can be identified in history, often as popular peasant games. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the nineteenth century. [3] [4] The expanse of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside of the directly controlled Empire. [5] By the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. [6] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

[8] They tend to use throwing and running as the main ways of moving the ball, and only kick on certain limited occasions. Body tackling is a major skill, and games typically involve short passages of play of 5–90 seconds. [8] Association football, Australian rules football and Gaelic football tend to use kicking to move the ball around the pitch, with handling more limited. Body tackles are less central to the game, and players are freer to move around the field ( offside laws are typically less strict). [8] Common rules among the sports include: [9] Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular. A clearly defined area in which to play the game. Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line. Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts . The goal or line being defended by the opposing team. Players being required to move the ball—depending on the code—by kicking, carrying, or hand-passing the ball. Players using only their body to move the ball. In all codes, common skills include passing , tackling , evasion of tackles, catching and kicking . [8] In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside , and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts. Etymology Main article: Football (word) There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word ""football"". It is widely assumed that the word ""football"" (or the phrase ""foot ball"") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball. [10] There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe , which were played on foot . There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation. Early history Ancient games A painting depicting Emperor Taizu of Song playing cuju (i.e. Chinese football) with his prime minister Zhao Pu (??) and other ministers, by the Yuan dynasty artist Qian Xuan (1235–1305) The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ""?????????"" ( Episkyros ) [11] [12] or ""????????"" ( phaininda ), [13] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football . [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis . [19] [20] Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA. [21] A Chinese game called Tsu' Chu, Cuju or Zuqiu has been recognised by FIFA as the first version of the game with regular rules. [22] It existed during the Han Dynasty , the second and third centuries BC. The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (??), and was developed during the Asuka period . [23] This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie ). [24] The game appears to have died out sometime before the mid-19th century. It was revived in 1903 and is now played at a number of festivals. [ citation needed ] There are a number of references to traditional , ancient , or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis , went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland . [25] There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk . Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey , a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans , called Pahsaheman . [ citation needed ] On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook ( Djab Wurrung for ""game ball""). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth , The Aborigines of Victoria , in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia , that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: ""Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it."" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football . The M?ori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target. [ citation needed ] Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball , [26] and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football."" [ citation needed ] These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.

Medieval and early modern Europe Further information: Medieval football The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th century Historia Brittonum , which describes ""a party of boys ... playing at ball"". [28] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule , in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, [29] date from the 12th century. [30] An illustration of so-called "" mob football "" The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "" mob football "", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse , [31] struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder [32] to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes. [33] The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas , or Easter , [32] and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below). The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday : After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents. [34] Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of ""ball play"" or ""playing at ball"". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked. An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham , Northumberland , England: ""Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David"". [35] Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a ""football game"" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. [36] Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham , Norfolk , England: ""[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself"". [35] In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone , Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [ rageries de grosses pelotes de pee ] [37] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football. In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning ""...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games"", [38] showing that ""football"" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball. A game known as ""football"" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a ""football"" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word ""pass"" in the most recent translation is derived from ""huc percute"" (strike it here) and later ""repercute pilam"" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as ""goal"" is ""metum"", literally meaning the ""pillar at each end of the circus course"" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball before [another player] does"" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation ""Throw yourself against him"" (Age, objice te illi). France circa 1750 King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word ""football"", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for ""foteball"". [35] [39] There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Cawston, Nottinghamshire . This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling : ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions"" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started. [35] Other firsts in the mediæval and early modern eras: ""a football"", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486. [39] This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners ' Book of St Albans . It states: ""a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."" [35] a pair of football boots was ordered by King Henry VIII of England in 1526. [40] women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems: ""[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes."" [41] the first references to goals are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to ""goals"" in Cornish hurling . Carew described how goals were made: ""they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales"". [42] He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players. the first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day 's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): ""I'll play a gole at camp-ball "" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia ). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to ""when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe"". Calcio Fiorentino An illustration of the Calcio Fiorentino field and starting positions, from a 1688 book by Pietro di Lorenzo Bini. Main article: Calcio Fiorentino In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as "" calcio storico "" (""historic kickball"") in the Piazza Santa Croce . The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino . This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930). Official disapproval and attempts to ban football Main article: Attempts to ban football games There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667. [43] :6 Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the enclosure act . Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world. Establishment of modern codes English public schools Main article: English public school football games While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (known as private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear. The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"". [44] Richard Mulcaster , a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"". [45] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"". Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football: [s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges. [46] In 1633, David Wedderburn , a teacher from Aberdeen , mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula. Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as ""keeping goal"" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (""strike it here""). There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball"", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (""drive that man back""). [47] A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby 's Book of Games , written in about 1660. [48] Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School , Sutton Coldfield , is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: ""a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals."" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics (""leaving some of their best players to guard the goal""); scoring (""they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win"") and the way teams were selected (""the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness""). He is the first to describe a ""law"" of football: ""they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball"". [ citation needed ] English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century. [49] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation . However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby , Harrow and Cheltenham , during between 1810 and 1850. [49] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 [50] and Aldenham in 1825. [50] ) During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force . Feast day football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules. Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse ). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters , making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games. [ citation needed ] Rugby School William Webb Ellis , a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory, [51] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards. The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host ""home"" school, and the other half by the visiting ""away"" school. The modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawnmower in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc. [52] Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below). Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act of 1850 , which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6 a.m. (7 a.m. in winter) or after 6 p.m. on weekdays (7 p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2 p.m. These changes mean that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football. Firsts Clubs Main article: Oldest football clubs Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796. [53] [54] The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh , Scotland , during the period 1824–41. [55] [56] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball. [56] In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football. [57] This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game. Competitions Main article: Oldest football competitions One of the longest running football fixture is the Cordner-Eggleston Cup , contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football , although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules . [58] The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup , contested since 1878. The South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup (1867) and the oldest national soccer competition is the English FA Cup (1871). The Football League (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league. The first ever international football match took place between sides representing England and Scotland on March 5, 1870 at the Oval under the authority of the FA. The first Rugby international took place in 1871. Modern balls Main article: Football (ball) Richard Lindon (seen in 1880) is believed to have invented the first footballs with rubber bladders. In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal bladders , more specifically pig's bladders , which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape. [59] However, in 1851, Richard Lindon and William Gilbert , both shoemakers from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London. Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders. [60] Lindon also won medals for the invention of the ""Rubber inflatable Bladder"" and the ""Brass Hand Pump"". In 1855, the U.S. inventor Charles Goodyear – who had patented vulcanised rubber – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the Paris Exhibition Universelle . The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A. [61] The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see truncated icosahedron ) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup in 1970 . Modern ball passing tactics Main article: Passing (association football) The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in Aberdeen , Scotland . [62] Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time) [63] ""Scientific"" football is first recorded in 1839 from Lancashire [64] and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862 [65] and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865. [66] [67] The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70 [68] [69] By 1869 they were ""work[ing] well together"", ""backing up"" and benefiting from ""cooperation"". [70] By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: ""Lieut. Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called"" [71] Passing was a regular feature of their style [72] By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for ""play[ing] beautifully together"" [73] A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a short pass: ""Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts"" [74] The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC [75] [76] [77] and introduced the 2–3–5 ""pyramid"" formation. [78] [79] Cambridge rules Main article: Cambridge rules In 1848, at Cambridge University , Mr. H. de Winton and Mr. J.C. Thring , who were both formerly at Shrewsbury School , called a meeting at Trinity College, Cambridge with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the Cambridge rules . No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School. [80] The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed when a player catches the ball directly from the foot entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from ""loitering"" around the opponents' goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on the Football Association committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football ). Sheffield rules Main article: Sheffield rules By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club , founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football. [81] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules . The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule. The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks , corner kicks , handball, throw-ins and the crossbar. [82] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877. Australian rules Main article: Australian rules football See also: Origins of Australian rules football Tom Wills , widely regarded as the father of Australian football There is archival evidence of ""foot-ball"" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne , the capital city of Victoria . In July 1858, Tom Wills , an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle , calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter. [83] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules, [84] the first of which was played on July 31, 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College . Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity. Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the Richmond Paddock , Melbourne , 1866 Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on May 14, 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley , J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison , a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"". [85] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark , free kick , tackling , lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball . The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club 's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking . The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies . Outside of its heartland in southern Australia the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world , and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition. Football Association Main article: The Football Association The first football international, Scotland versus England . Once kept by the Rugby Football Union as an early example of rugby football . During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster. At the Freemasons' Tavern , Great Queen Street, London on the evening of October 26, 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. [86] Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows: IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run. X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time. [87] At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. M. Campbell , the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: ""hacking is the true football"". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "" Laws of Football "", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football . The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""Association"". [88] The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark , which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line. Rugby football Main article: History of rugby union A rugby scrum in 1871 In Britain , by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try , where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest. North American football codes Main articles: History of American football and Canadian football § History As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football , a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s. [89] They remained largely "" mob football "" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common. [90] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale University , under pressure from the city of New Haven , banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861. [90] In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the "" Boston game "", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club . The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the ""Boston game"" on Boston Common . [90] [91] The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers , and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association . [90] The ""Tigers"" of Hamilton, Ontario , circa 1906. Founded 1869 as the Hamilton Foot Ball Club, they eventually merged with the Hamilton Flying Wildcats to form the Hamilton Tiger-Cats , a team still active in the Canadian Football League . [92] In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school. [93] In 1864, at Trinity College , Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football . [93] A ""running game"", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868. [94] On November 6, 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football . [90] [95] Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal, and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard. [96] [97] [98] Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and had persuaded other U.S. university teams to do the same. On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts , agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations. [99] Rutgers College Football Team, 1882 In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp , who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby was replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules. [99] American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death. [100] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, urging them to make drastic changes. [101] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass . Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game. [102] Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules , which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others. [103] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929. [104] American and Canadian football remain different codes , stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not. Gaelic football The All-Ireland Football Final in Croke Park , 2004. Main article: History of Gaelic football In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as caid , remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry . One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the ""field game"" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic ""cross-country game"" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. ""Wrestling"", ""holding"" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed. By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College, Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping. There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on February 7, 1887. Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football). Schism in Rugby football An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of rugby league . The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads: Marshall: ""Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can’t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!"" Miller: ""Yes, that's just you to a T; you’d make it so that no lad whose father wasn’t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn’t have a share in the spending of it."" Further information: History of rugby league The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already began to creep into the various codes of football. In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport. The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better ""spectator"" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the line-out . This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the ""play-the-ball ruck"", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League , the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England. Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union . Globalisation of association football Main article: History of FIFA The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904. Its first president was Robert Guérin . The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries. Further divergence of the two rugby codes Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux . During the second half of 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs : a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately). The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule . With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10 metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes. The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from marks were abolished, kicks directly into touch from outside the 22 metre line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul , and the lifting of players in line-outs was legalised. In 1995, rugby union became an ""open"" game, that is one which allowed professional players. Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future. A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a ""wall"", in Association football Use of the word ""football"" For more details on this topic, see Football (word) . The word "" football "" , when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term football , primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world . Most often, the word ""football"" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word ""football"" means usually depends on where one says it. Players assemble at the line of scrimmage in an American football game. In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union , but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league , depending on popularity (which largely conforms to what has been called the Barassi Line ). In francophone Quebec , where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as football while American football is known as Football américain and association football is known as le soccer . [105] Of the 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names. A few FIFA affiliates have recently ""normalised"" to using ""Football"", including: Australia's association football governing body changed its name in 2005 from using ""soccer"" to ""football"" [106] New Zealand's governing body also changed in 2007, saying ""the international game is called football."" [107] Samoa changed from ""Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation"" to "" Football Federation Samoa "" in 2009. [108] [109] Popularity Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world. [7] Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations, [110] and has the highest television audience in sport, [111] making it the most popular in the world, [112] American football is the most popular sport in the United States, [113] with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for seven of the top eight of the most watched broadcasts in U.S. television history . [114] Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia. [115] [116] Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance, [117] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.

Rugby school football and descendants These codes have in common the ability of players to carry the ball with their hands, and to throw it to teammates, unlike association football where the use of hands is prohibited by anyone except the goal keeper. They also feature various methods of scoring based upon whether the ball is carried into the goal area, or kicked through a target. Rugby football Rugby union Mini rugby a variety for children.

During the latter half of the 1870s, colleges playing association football switched to the Rugby code. ^ In 1845, the first rules of rugby were written by Rugby School pupils. But various rules of rugby had existed until the foundation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. ^ There are Canadian rules [1] established by Football Canada . Apart from this, there are also rules [2] established by IFAF . ^ Some historians support the theory that the primary influence was rugby football and other games emanating from English public schools.

42," Association football - Wikipedia Association football From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search ""Soccer"" redirects here. For other uses, see Soccer (disambiguation) . This article is about the sport of association football. For other codes of football, see Football . Association football The attacking player (No. 10) attempts to kick the ball beyond the opposing team's goalkeeper, between the goalposts, and beneath the crossbar to score a goal . Highest governing body FIFA Nicknames Football, soccer, the Beautiful Game , the World Game [1] First played 19 December 1863, Limes Field, Mortlake , London , England, United Kingdom [2] Characteristics Contact Yes ( Limited ) Team members 11 per side (including goalkeeper) Mixed gender Yes, separate competitions Type Team sport , ball sport Equipment Football (or soccer ball) Venue Football pitch (also known as football field, football ground, soccer field, soccer pitch or simply ""pitch"") Presence Country or region Worldwide Olympic Yes, men's since the 1900 Olympics and women's since the 1996 Olympics Paralympic Yes, 5-a-side since 2004 and 7-a-side since 1984 Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , [3] nicknamed The World Game or The Beautiful Game , is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball . It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. [4] [5] [6] [7] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area . Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French : Fédération Internationale de Football Association ), which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years.

The term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford ""-er"" abbreviation of the word ""association"". [9] Within the English-speaking world , association football is now usually called football in the United Kingdom and mainly soccer in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use ""football"" for the formal name. [10] History Main article: History of association football Children playing cuju in Song dynasty China. An episkyros player on an ancient stone carving at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. [11] According to FIFA , the Chinese competitive game cuju (??, literally ""kick ball"") is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific evidence. [12] Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred. [13] [14] During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established. [13] Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games. [15] [16] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens [11] appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup. [17] Athenaeus , writing in 228 AD, referenced the Roman ball game harpastum . Phaininda , episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football , wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football. [13] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] As with pre-codified "" mob football "", the antecedent of all modern football codes , these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking. [23] [24] Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan, chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia. [25] [26] Association football in itself does not have a classical history. [27] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA have recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. [28] The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD . [29] The Cambridge Rules , first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge , at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton , Harrow , Rugby , Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club , formed by former public school pupils in 1857, [30] which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules. [31] These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street , London. [32] The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse . The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath , withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union . The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley , went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. [32] These rules included handling of the ball by ""marks"" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games. [33] The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup , which was founded by C. W. Alcock and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow , again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league , which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor . [34] The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England . The laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). [35] The board was formed in 1886 [36] after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association , the Football Association of Wales , and the Irish Football Association . FIFA , the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association. [37] The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations. [38] Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, [39] while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. [40] A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. [41] Football has the highest global television audience in sport. [42] In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities, and even nations. R. Kapuscinski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. [43] The Côte d'Ivoire national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 [44] and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké , an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. [45] By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. [46] The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990. [47] Women's association football Main article: Women's association football A women's international match between the United States and Germany Early women's football Women may have been playing ""football"" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ( Tsu Chu ) was played by women during the Han Dynasty (25–220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in Han Dynasty (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu. [48] There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE. [49] Reports of an annual match being played in Scotland are reported as early as the 1790s. [50] [51] The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow . In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895. [52] [53] Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. In Europe, it is possible that 12th-century French women played football as part of that era's folk games. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. [50] [51] In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. [52] The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club . Nettie Honeyball is quoted, ""I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation , and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most."" [54] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game. [55] A Welsh women's football team pose for a photograph in 1959 Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War , when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England . The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris , France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0. [50] Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), [56] women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful. [57] Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. [58] This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds. [59] Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century. [60] [61] It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom. [61] In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women. [61] 20th and 21st century The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a ""golden age"" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches; [62] this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971. [61] The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since, [63] while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996 . Gameplay A goalkeeper saving a close-range shot from inside the penalty area Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game . The game is played using a spherical ball of 68.5–69.5 cm (27.0–27.4 in) circumference, [64] known as the football (or soccer ball ). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks . [65] The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they do use their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, ""heading"" with the forehead) [66] other than their hands or arms. [67] Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an offside position. [68] A player executing a slide tackle to dispossess an opponent In game play, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling , passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart. [69] At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. [70] The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, [71] but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers , or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders , who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders , who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. [72] The layout of a team's players is known as a formation . Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager . [73] Laws ""Rules of football"" redirects here. For the rules of other football games, see Football . Main article: Laws of the Game (association football) There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). [74] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. Players, equipment, and officials See also: Association football positions , Formation (association football) , and Kit (association football) The referee officiates in a football match Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes ), one of whom must be the goalkeeper . Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws. [71] The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards . An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. [75] [76] Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials. [77] A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches . Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. [78] IFAB recommends ""that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team."" Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations. [79] A game is officiated by a referee , who has ""full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed"" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees . In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise. [80] Ball Main article: Ball (association football) The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 centimetres (27 and 28 in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 grams (14 to 16 oz), and a pressure of between 0.6 and 1.1 bars (8.5 and 15.6 psi) at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic. [81] [82] Pitch Main article: Football pitch Standard pitch measurements ( See Imperial version ) As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB , the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units . The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain. [83] The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (344 ft) long and 68 m (223 ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; [84] however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented. [85] The longer boundary lines are touchlines , while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines . A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line. [86] The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 24 feet (7.3 m) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 8 feet (2.4 m) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws. [87] In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs , goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks. [88] Duration and tie-breaking methods A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. [89] The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, [90] [91] but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time , while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. [89] Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa . Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90 minutes had elapsed and the game was over. [92] The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken. [93] Some football competitions use a penalty shootout to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke replays . [94] A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as ""kicks from the penalty mark"") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score). [65] In competitions using two-legged matches , each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required. [65] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored ( golden goal ), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time ( silver goal ). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002 . The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France 's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996 . Silver goal was used in Euro 2004 . Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB. [95] Ball in and out of play Main article: Ball in and out of play Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play . From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play: A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a ""wall"" to try to block the ball Kick-off : following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play. [69] Throw-in : when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball. [96] Goal kick : when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team. [97] Corner kick : when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team. [98] Indirect free kick : awarded to the opposing team following ""non-penal"" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick. [99] Direct free kick : awarded to fouled team following certain listed ""penal"" fouls. [99] A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick. Penalty kick : awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area. [100] Dropped-ball : occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective. [69] Misconduct Main article: Foul (association football) On-field Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the 1970 FIFA World Cup and used consistently since. A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of ""penal fouls"", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick . [67] The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution ( yellow card ) or dismissal ( red card ). A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been ""booked"", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of ""unsporting behaviour"" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner. [67] Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as ""playing an advantage"". [101] The referee may ""call back"" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within ""a few seconds"". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play. [102] The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. [103] The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect. Off-field See also: Foul (association football) § Post-match Women's football final at 2007 Pan Am games. Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping , age fraud and match fixing . Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. [104] Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. [105] Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh. [104] Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points from a team that enters financial administration . Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win. Governing bodies See also: Association football around the world Headquarters of FIFA , the world governing body of football The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer ) is FIFA . The FIFA headquarters are located in Zürich , Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are: [106] Asia: Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Africa: Confederation of African Football (CAF) Europe: Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) North/Central America & Caribbean: Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Oceania: Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) South America: Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL) National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the Fédération Camerounaise de Football in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations. [106] While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the International Football Association Board , where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes. [38] International competitions Main article: List of association football competitions A minute of silence before an international match The major international competition in football is the World Cup , organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period. [107] The most recent edition of the tournament was the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles . [108] Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only; [37] however, since the 1984 Summer Olympics , professional players have been permitted, albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides. The Olympic men's tournament is played at Under-23 level. In the past the Olympics have allowed a restricted number of over-age players per team. [109] A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament. [110] Spanish footballers celebrating winning the UEFA European Championship After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup . [111] Domestic competitions Main article: Association football around the world A match in the top football league in Germany The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season , normally comprising several divisions , in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables , placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament . At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division. [112] The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing ), awarding a champion for each. [113] The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more ""cup"" competitions organised on a knock-out basis. Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues – the Bundesliga (Germany), Premier League (England), [114] La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) – attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion. [115] Variants and casual play See also: Variants of association football and Street football Play media To many, football is more than just a sport: a video short on the many styles and ethnicities who play football. Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. five-a-side football ) play in non-field environments (i.e. beach soccer , indoor soccer , and futsal ) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. paralympic association football ). One of the attractions of association football is that a casual game can be played with only minimal equipment – a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can often have team sizes that vary considerably from eleven-a-side, use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and are likely to be self-officiated by the players.

Medieval origins Modern football has its origins in the streets of medieval England. Neighbouring towns would play each other in games where a heaving mass of players would struggle to drag a pig’s bladder by any means possible to markers at either end of town. A royal ban Football became so violent in England it was banned by the king for more than 300 years. English public schools are credited with subsequently establishing the modern football codes, thus turning the mob riot into a sport in the 16th century. Olympic history Football first appeared on the programme of the Games of the II Olympiad, Paris 1900. It has been on the programme of each edition of the Games ever since, with the exception of Los Angeles 1932. Europe dominated the competition until after 1992 in Barcelona, where Spain became the last European team to win a gold medal. Since the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, African and South American teams have won all the gold medals. Also in 1996, women’s football was introduced into the Olympic programme. Three times, the USA has been on the highest step of the podium - in 1996, in 2004 in Athens and in 2008 in Beijing. But this team was beaten by the Norwegians in the final of the 2000 Games in Sydney. More The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in 1904. Football made its full medal debut at the 1908 London Games. International Association Football Federation Featured Stories Go to Featured Stories ?

NFL Browns vs. Ravens live scores, highlights, and updates from 'Thursday Night Football' Baltimore can strengthen its place atop the AFC North by sending Cleveland to a 10th straight loss. by Christian D'Andrea Nov 10, 2016, 11:34pm EST tweet share pin Rec Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images Final score: Ravens 28, Browns 7 Third Quarter : Ravens 21, Browns 7 Second Quarter : Browns 7, Ravens 6 First Quarter : Browns 0, Ravens 0 Browns/Ravens highlights You’ve probably never heard of him before, but Seth DeValve caught a touchdown pass for the Browns ! Raise your hand if you have him on your fantasy football team. No one? Oh, that’s too bad. Oh, hey! Josh McCown is in the game and — yup! — he threw an immediate interception . Browns rookie OL Spencer Drango used the Mannequin Challenge as a blocking technique . Surprise, McCown got crushed. Injuries Ravens left guard Alex Lewis injured his right ankle and did not return. Before the game The Baltimore Ravens halted a four-game losing streak to regain their spot at the top of the AFC North. All they have to do to stay there is defend their home field against the winless Cleveland Browns on Thursday Night Football . The Ravens currently lead the division after toppling the Steelers in Week 9, but with a 4-4 record, they’re the weakest link in the NFL’s projected playoff field. The division remains wide open for Baltimore, 4-4 Pittsburgh, and 3-4-1 Cincinnati, leaving only one team on the outside looking in. And as usual, it’s the Browns. Cleveland sealed its 10th straight losing season on Sunday when it was torched by the 7-1 Cowboys down in Dallas. The Browns haven’t seen the happy side of .500 in nearly two years, but can at least use 2016’s lost campaign to get a better idea of what young talent is worth keeping on its roster. That’s why head coach Hue Jackson has decided to keep rookie Cody Kessler in the starting lineup, at least for now. “The quarterback's job is to get the team to win,” Jackson said. Kessler has been steady, if unspectacular, in his first season as a pro. He’ll face a stiff test on Thursday against Baltimore. The Ravens hounded Ben Roethlisberger en route to a 21-14 victory last week, holding him to just a 67.6 QB rating. Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco, on the other hand, should have a much easier time finding his targets. The Browns have been the league’s second-worst passing defense in 2016. If an embattled secondary can’t reverse that trend, 0-16 will sneak up on Cleveland much faster than anyone would have hoped for. Pregame reading Without Paul Brown, there are no Cleveland Browns.
